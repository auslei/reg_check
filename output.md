###### About the NCC

The NCC is Australia’s primary set of technical design and construction provisions for buildings. As a performance-based
code, it sets the minimum required level for the safety, health, amenity, accessibility and sustainability of certain buildings.
It primarily applies to the design and construction of new buildings, and plumbing and drainage systems in new and existing
buildings. In some cases it may also apply to structures associated with buildings and new building work or new plumbing
and drainage work in existing buildings.

The Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB), on behalf of the Australian Government and each State and Territory
government, produces and maintains the NCC. When determining the content of the NCC, the ABCB seeks to—

###### • ensure requirements have a rigorously tested rationale; and

 • effectively and proportionally address applicable issues; and

 • create benefits to society that outweigh costs; and

 • consider non-regulatory alternatives; and

 • consider the competitive effects of regulation; and

 • not be unnecessarily restrictive.

The primary users of the NCC include architects, builders, plumbers, building surveyors, hydraulic consultants, engineers
and other building and plumbing related professions and trades.

###### Format of the NCC

The NCC is published in three volumes. The Building Code of Australia (BCA) is Volumes One and Two of the NCC and
the Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) is Volume Three of the NCC.

###### Components of the NCC

The NCC provides the technical provisions for the design and construction of buildings and other structures, and plumbing
and drainage systems.

NCC Volume One primarily covers the design and construction of multi-residential, commercial, industrial and public
assembly buildings and some associated structures.

NCC Volume Two primarily covers the design and construction of smaller scale buildings including houses, small sheds,
carports and some associated structures.

NCC Volume Three covers the design, construction and maintenance of plumbing and drainage systems in new and
existing buildings.

Each volume contains—

###### • Governing Requirements; and

 • Performance Requirements; and

 • compliance options to meet the NCC requirements; and

 • State and Territory variations and additions.

The NCC uses building classifications to identify requirements for different intended purposes of buildings or parts of
buildings. A building classification relates to the characteristics and the intended use of the building. Information on building
classifications is found in Part A6 of the Governing Requirements.

###### Legislative arrangements and the NCC

The NCC is given legal effect through State and Territory, or other statutory authority, building and plumbing legislation.
These Acts and Regulations set out the legal framework and administration mechanisms for the NCC to support the design
and construction of buildings.


-----

The dates of adoption of the NCC are determined by State and Territory building and plumbing administrations.

###### How to use the NCC

Each volume of the NCC is split into two main sections:

###### • Administrative requirements contained within the Governing Requirements.

 • Technical requirements contained within the remaining sections of the NCC.

The Governing Requirements provide the rules and instructions for using and complying with the NCC. They are vital in
understanding how the technical requirements of the NCC should be applied to any particular situation. The Governing
Requirements are also important in understanding how the NCC fits with the building and plumbing regulatory framework
within Australia.

###### NCC clause numbering system

The NCC uses a uniform clause numbering system across each of its three volumes. This system is called Section-PartType-Clause (SPTC). In each clause number—

###### • The first letter indicates which NCC Section sits within, or if the letter S is used, that the clause is part of a Specification.

The letter S is used in place of a Section indicator because the same Specification may be called up in several different
Sections of the NCC.

###### • The first number indicates the number of each Part within a Section, or the number of a Specification. Parts are

numbered sequentially within each Section, starting at 1. Specifications are numbered sequentially across all three
volumes, also starting at 1.

###### • The second letter indicates the clause Type. It will be G, O, F, P, V, D or C and these are explained below.

 • The second number is the clause number within each Part or Specification.

The clause Types used in the NCC are as follows:

###### • G = Governing requirement (mandatory)

 • O = Objective (guidance)

 • F = Functional Statement (guidance)

 • P = Performance Requirement (mandatory)

 • V = Verification Method (optional)

 • D = Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision (optional) 

 • C = Clause in a Specification (clauses in Specifications may be mandatory or optional, depending on how the

Specification is called up by the NCC).

Informative parts of the NCC (e.g. Introduction to the NCC) are not numbered and do not have numbered paragraphs.
This helps make it easy to see that their content is information only and does not contain any regulatory requirements.

###### About NCC Volume Two

NCC Volume Two contains technical design and construction requirements for certain residential and non-habitable
buildings and structures.

Volume Two contains the requirements for—

###### • Class 1 and 10a buildings (other than access requirements for people with a disability in Class 1b and 10a buildings);

and

###### • certain Class 10b structures (other than access requirements for people with a disability in Class 10b swimming pools);

and

###### • Class 10c private bushfire shelters.

 Components of NCC Volume Two

NCC Volume Two contains the following Sections:

###### • Section A – Governing Requirements

 • Section H – Housing:

◾ Part H1 – Structure

◾ Part H2 – Damp and weatherproofing

◾ Part H3 – Fire safety

###### Introduction to this Part

This Part explains important concepts on how the NCC must be interpreted and applied. There are certain conventions
and approaches that need to be taken into account when using the NCC. This includes interpreting specific language and
terms. This is critical to understanding the intended technical and legal meaning of the NCC. This Part also explains the
difference between the mandatory Parts of the NCC and the Parts that are only explanatory or guidance in nature.


###### Governing Requirements

_TAS A1G4(7)_


**Notes**

For Volume Three, if a word is not defined in Schedule 1, the meaning (if any) attributed to it under AS/NZS 3500.0
should be used unless the contrary intention appears.


**Explanatory Information**

Explanatory information and Introduction information contained in the NCC is non-mandatory and is provided for
guidance purposes only. This informative material should be read in conjunction with the technical provisions of the
NCC. Any statements made in the informative and guidance components of the NCC should not be taken to override
the NCC. Unlike the NCC, which is adopted by legislation, the informative and guidance components are not called up
into legislation and they do not cover State and Territory variations and additions. Because informative and guidance
components of the NCC do not have regulatory force, the ABCB accepts no responsibility for its contents when applied
to specific buildings or any liability which may result from its use.

Defined words provide the precise meaning and expressions of key words used for understanding and complying with
the NCC. Where a word is not defined in the NCC, the relevant common meaning of the word should be used.


-----

provision is applicable to a specific class or classes of building, that reference to a building may be a reference to the
whole building or part of the building depending on how the building is classified.

Classes 1a and 1b, 7a and 7b, 9a, 9b and 9c, and 10a, 10b and 10c are separate classifications. In the NCC, when the
designation ‘a’, ‘b’ or ‘c’ is not applied, the reference is to all buildings of the general class. For example, ‘Class 9b’
refers only to Class 9b buildings, but ‘Class 9’ refers to Classes 9a, 9b and 9c.

Whether a provision applies or not depends on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances in which the
reference is made. For example, where a building has a single classification, a reference to a building in the NCC is
understandably a reference to a whole building. However, where a building has parts of different classification, unless
the contrary intention appears (i.e. there is a specific reference to the whole building), a reference to a building in the
NCC is a reference to the relevant part of the building. This means that each part of the building must comply with the
relevant provisions for its classification.

A number of the Performance Requirements of the NCC use the expression “to the degree necessary” or “appropriate
to”. These expressions provide flexibility by allowing appropriate authorities to determine the degree of compliance
necessary in a particular case. Therefore, any part of the NCC that uses these expressions should be referenced against
the requirements of the appropriate authority. For example, an appropriate authority might judge that an item need not
be installed, or a particular level of performance be achieved.

Application, Limitation, and Exemption statements are used to identify provisions that may or may not apply in certain
situations, to varying degrees.

Figures are used to explain the requirements of a particular clause. To ensure the context of the requirement is clearly
understood, adjacent construction elements of the building that would normally be required in that particular situation
are not always shown. Accordingly, aspects of figures that are not shown should not be interpreted as meaning these
construction details are not required. Therefore a figure must not be used as an indication of the full construction
requirements in a given situation, as the only available option, or a substitute for referencing appropriate construction
requirements (in other sources) for a given clause.

(2) A Performance Solution must be shown to comply with the relevant Performance Requirements through one or a
combination of the following Assessment Methods:

(a) Evidence of suitability in accordance with Part A5 that shows the use of a material, product, plumbing and

_drainage_ _product, form of construction or design meets the relevant Performance Requirements._

(b) A Verification Method including the following:

(i) The Verification Methods provided in the NCC.

(ii) Other Verification Methods, accepted by the appropriate authority that show compliance with the relevant

_Performance Requirements_


-----

(c) _Expert Judgement._

(d) Comparison with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.

(3) Where a Performance Requirement is satisfied entirely by a Performance Solution, in order to comply with (1) the
following method must be used to determine the Performance Requirement or Performance Requirements relevant
to the Performance Solution:

(a) Identify the relevant Performance Requirements from the Section or Part to which the Performance Solution

applies.

(b) Identify _Performance Requirements from other Sections or Parts that are relevant to any aspects of the_

_Performance Solution proposed or that are affected by the application of the Performance Solution._

(4) Where a Performance Requirement is proposed to be satisfied by a Performance Solution, the following steps must
be undertaken:

(a) Prepare a performance-based design brief in consultation with relevant stakeholders.

(b) Carry out analysis, as proposed by the performance-based design brief.

(c) Evaluate results from (4)(b) against the acceptance criteria in the performance-based design brief.

(d) Prepare a final report that includes—

(i) all Performance Requirements and/or Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions identified through A2G2(3) or A2G4(3)

as applicable; and

(ii) identification of all Assessment Methods used; and

(iii) details of steps (4)(a) to (4)(c); and

(iv) confirmation that the Performance Requirement has been met; and

(v) details of conditions or limitations, if any exist, regarding the Performance Solution.

_VIC A2G2(5)_

###### A2G3 Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution

[2019: A2.3]

(1) A solution that complies with the _Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions is deemed to have met the_ _Performance_
_Requirements._

(2) A Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution can show compliance with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions through one or more of
the following Assessment Methods:

(a) Evidence of suitability in accordance with Part A5 that shows the use of a material, product, plumbing and

_drainage_ _product, form of construction or design meets a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision._

(b) _Expert Judgement._

###### A2G4 A combination of solutions

[2019: A2.4]

(1) _Performance Requirements may be satisfied by using a combination of Performance Solutions and Deemed-to-_
_Satisfy Solutions._

(2) When using a combination of solutions, compliance can be shown through the following, as appropriate:

(a) A2G2 for assessment against the relevant Performance Requirements.

(b) A2G3 for assessment against the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.

(3) Where a Performance Requirement is satisfied by a Performance Solution in combination with a Deemed-to-Satisfy
_Solution, in order to comply with (1), the following method must be used to determine the Performance Requirement_
or Performance Requirements relevant to the Performance Solution:

(a) Identify the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of each Section or Part that are to be the subject of the

_Performance Solution._

(b) Identify the Performance Requirements from the same Sections or Parts that are relevant to the identified


-----

_Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions._

(c) Identify _Performance Requirements from other Sections or Parts that are relevant to any aspects of any_

_Performance Solution proposed or that are affected by the application of the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions that_
are the subject of the Performance Solution.


**Explanatory Information**

To comply with the NCC, a solution must achieve compliance with the Governing Requirements and the Performance
_Requirements. The Governing Requirements contain requirements about how the Performance Requirements must be_
met.

_Performance Requirements outline the minimum necessary standards different buildings or building elements must_
attain. The Performance Requirements are the only NCC technical provisions that must be satisfied.

In some instances, State and Territory variations and additions may also be applicable to certain _Performance_
_Requirements._

A solution may be partly a Performance Solution and partly a Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution. However, no matter what
method is chosen, building proponents need to always meet the Performance Requirements of the NCC.

A2G2(2)(b)(ii) provides for the use of Verification Methods that are not listed in the NCC. A Verification Method may
include—

###### • a calculation, using analytical methods or mathematical models; or

 • a test, using a technical procedure, either on-site or in a laboratory, to directly measure the extent to which the

_Performance Requirements have been met; or_

###### • an inspection (and inspection report); or

 • any other acceptable form of certification.

Any Verification Method used must be acceptable to the appropriate authority.

A Performance Solution must comply with all applicable Performance Requirements of the NCC. A Performance Solution
provides a tailored solution to meet the intended objective of the Performance Requirements. A Performance Solution
must comply with all relevant Performance Requirements and must be verified using one or a combination of the
following Assessment Methods:

###### • Evidence of suitability.

 • Verification Method.

 • Expert Judgement.

 • Comparison with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.

For example, building proponents who wish to know what has to be done to satisfy the fire safety _Performance_
_Requirements for a particular building can either follow the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions or develop a Performance_
_Solution. Guidance on how to develop Performance Solutions can be found on the ABCB website at: www.abcb.gov.au._
The ABCB Resource Library contains information on the development of Performance Solutions for both building and
plumbing.

A Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution is achieved by following all appropriate Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions in the NCC. The
_Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions are prescriptive (i.e. like a recipe book, they tell you how, what and in which location_
things must be done). They include materials, components, design factors, and construction methods that, if used, are
deemed to meet the Performance Requirements, hence the term “Deemed-to-Satisfy”.

A Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution may be verified using one or a combination of the following Assessment Methods:

###### • Evidence of suitability.

 • Expert Judgement.

Some _Performance Requirements are without_ _Deemed-to-Satisfy Solutions. Compliance with these_ _Performance_
_Requirements must be achieved by using a Performance Solution._

When designing a building or _plumbing or_ _drainage system, both_ _Performance Solutions and_ _Deemed-to-Satisfy_
_Solutions can be used to achieve compliance with Performance Requirements. A combination of solutions may be used_
to satisfy a single Performance Requirement. This may include occasions where a specific Performance Requirement
covers a number of elements of a building or plumbing or drainage system.

No NCC provision can be considered in isolation Any departure from the Deemed to Satisfy Provisions for a


-----

_Performance Solution needs to be assessed against the relevant Performance Requirements within the relevant NCC_
Section or Part. Additionally, the proposed Performance Solution may also impact on other Performance Requirements
in other Sections or Parts. Thus, these additional Performance Requirements need to be considered in relation to the
subject _Performance Solution._ A2G2(3) and A2G4(3) set out the methods for determining which _Performance_
_Requirements are relevant._

It is important that a holistic approach is used when determining the appropriate Performance Requirements.

A2G4(2)(a) references A2G2. Therefore, when using a combination of Performance Solutions and Deemed-to-Satisfy
_Solutions it is necessary to comply with A2G2(4) where a Performance Requirement is proposed to be satisfied by a_
_Performance Solution._

More information on NCC compliance methods is located at www.abcb.gov.au.

###### Introduction to this Part

This Part explains applying the NCC in accordance with State or Territory legislation. The NCC has legal effect through
references in relevant State or Territory building and plumbing legislation.

Although the NCC is a nationally consistent code, there are some situations where a State or Territory enforces a variation,
addition or deletion to it. This Part also explains how these variations, additions and deletions apply.


###### Governing Requirements


###### A3G1 State and Territory compliance

(1) For application within a particular State or Territory, the volumes of the NCC comprise inclusively of—

(a) Sections A to G, I and J and associated schedules of Volume One; and

(b) Sections A and H and associated schedules of Volume Two; and

(c) Sections A to E and associated schedules of Volume Three.



[2019: A3.0]


(2) State and Territory variations, additions and deletions must be complied with in conjunction with the NCC.

(3) The NCC is subject to, and may be overridden by, State or Territory legislation.

(4) State and Territory variations, additions and deletions are contained in the following Schedules:

(a) Schedule 3: Commonwealth of Australia.

(b) Schedule 4: Australian Capital Territory.

(c) Schedule 5: New South Wales.

(d) Schedule 6: Northern Territory.

(e) Schedule 7: Queensland.

(f) Schedule 8: South Australia.

(g) Schedule 9: Tasmania.

(h) Schedule 10: Victoria.

(i) Schedule 11: Western Australia.

(5) State and Territory variations and deletions are identified throughout the NCC.


**Explanatory Information**

The NCC is given legal effect by building regulatory legislation in each State and Territory. This legislation consists of
an Act of Parliament and subordinate legislation which empowers the regulation of certain aspects of building and
plumbing, and contains the administrative provisions necessary to give effect to the legislation.

Although the NCC is a national code, in some instances it is necessary for a State or Territory to vary or apply additional
requirements specific to their jurisdiction. A3G1(2) highlights that these variations, additions or deletions must be applied
in conjunction with the NCC provisions. Typically, these variations, additions or deletions override the requirements
contained within the NCC.

Any provision of the NCC may be overridden by, or subject to, State or Territory legislation. The NCC must therefore be
read in conjunction with that legislation. Any queries on such matters should be referred to the State or Territory authority
responsible for building and plumbing regulatory matters.

Where a requirement or provision of the NCC is subject to a State or Territory variation, addition, or deletion, a reference
to the appropriate provision in the applicable State or Territory schedule is included with that requirement or provision.


-----

###### Introduction to this Part

This Part explains how documents referenced in the NCC are adopted and applied. The NCC itself does not contain details
of every design and construction requirement for a building or plumbing or drainage system. As such, the NCC calls upon
or “references” other documents with this information. These are called NCC referenced documents. Examples of such
documents are Australian Standards, ABCB protocols, ABCB standards and other publications.

There are multiple types of referenced documents. A primary referenced document is one referenced in Schedule 2 of the
NCC. A secondary referenced document is one referenced in a primary referenced document. Other referenced documents
are referenced by secondary and subsequently referenced documents.


###### Governing Requirements


###### A4G1 Referenced documents

[2019: A4.0]

(1) A reference in the NCC to a document refers to the edition or issues and any amendment listed in Schedule 2.

(2) A document referenced in the NCC is only applicable in the context in which the document is quoted.

_TAS A4G1(3)_

(3) Where a new edition, issue or amendment of a primary referenced document is not listed in Schedule 2, the new
edition, issue or amendment is not referenced for the purpose of the NCC.

(4) Any document referenced in a primary referenced document is known as a secondary referenced document.

(5) A reference in a primary referenced document to a secondary or other referenced document is a reference to the
document as it existed at the time of publication of the primary referenced document.


**Applications**

A4G1 applies to documents referenced in the ABCB Housing Provisions in the same way as for documents referenced
within any other part of the NCC.


**Exemptions**

If the secondary or other referenced document is also a primary referenced document, A4G1(5) does not apply.


###### A4G2 Differences between referenced documents and the NCC

[2019: A4.1]

The NCC overrules any difference between the NCC (including the ABCB Housing Provisions) and a primary referenced
document, including any secondary referenced document.


**Applications**

A4G2 applies to documents referenced in the ABCB Housing Provisions in the same way as for other documents
referenced by Volumes One, Two or Three of the NCC.


-----

###### A4G3 Adoption of referenced documents

[2019: A4.2]

The NCC does not require compliance with requirements in relation to the following matters where they are prescribed in
a referenced document:

(a) The rights, responsibilities or obligations between the manufacturer, supplier or purchaser.

(b) The responsibilities of any tradesperson or other building operative, architect, engineer, authority, or other person

or body.

(c) The submission for approval of any material, building component, form or method of construction, to any person,

authority or body other than those empowered under State or Territory legislation to give that approval.

(d) The submission of a material, product, form of construction or design to any person, authority or body for opinion.

(e) Any departure from the NCC, rule, specification or provision at the sole discretion of the manufacturer or

purchaser, or by arrangement or agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser.


**Applications**

A4G3 applies to documents referenced in the ABCB Housing Provisions in the same way as for documents referenced
within Volumes One, Two or Three of the NCC.


**Explanatory Information**

Schedule 2 is only mandatory to Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, Specifications and Verification Methods. However,
referenced documents are only applicable to the NCC provision that references the document.

A proponent undertaking a Performance Solution can use any element or edition of any document, if they help satisfy
the Performance Requirements. They do not need to use the documents listed in Schedule 2.

Schedule 2 lists the specific edition of the Standard or other document adopted, including any amendments considered
appropriate for Schedule 2, the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, Specifications or Verification Methods. Other editions of
(or amendments to) the referenced document are not adopted and have no standing under the NCC.

A primary referenced document may refer to a secondary referenced document. A4G1(5) stipulates that the secondary
referenced document is the edition of the document that existed at the time of publication of the primary referenced
document. When another edition of (or amendment to) a secondary referenced document is released, subject to the
exemption to A4G1, that edition (or amendment) is not adopted for the purposes of the primary referenced document.

A4G3 means that contractual matters or clauses defining responsibilities of various parties, and matters not appropriate
for adoption in the NCC are not included when a document is called up in the NCC.

###### Introduction to this Part

This Part explains the evidence needed to show that the NCC requirements are met and the solution is “fit for purpose”.
It covers the use of materials, products, forms of construction and designs. It details separate requirements for the BCA
and PCA.

Examples of evidence to be prepared and retained include certificates, reports, calculations and any other documents or
information showing compliance with the NCC requirements.


###### Governing Requirements


###### A5G1 Suitability

[2019: A5.0]

(1) A building and plumbing or drainage installation must be constructed using materials, products, plumbing _products,_
forms of construction and designs fit for their intended purpose to achieve the relevant requirements of the NCC.

(2) For the purposes of (1), a material, product, plumbing _product, form of construction or design is fit for purpose if it_
is—

(a) supported by evidence of suitability in accordance with—

(i) A5G2; and

(ii) A5G3 or A5G4 as appropriate; and

(b) constructed or installed in an appropriate manner.


**Explanatory Information**

A5G1 relates to the quality of work and materials needed to construct a building to meet NCC requirements.

This means that—

###### • all people involved with construction must work skillfully in accordance with good trade practice; and

 • all materials must be of a quality to fulfil their function/s within the building.

A5G1 only applies to matters normally covered by the NCC.

While A5G1 outlines quality of work and material demands, sometimes additional conditions may be required by—

###### • other Commonwealth, State or Territory legislation; and

 • contracts that include either specific quality requirements, or requirements for specific materials and the like.


**Explanatory Information: Example**

Permit authorities would ordinarily not apply A5G1 to such matters as—

###### • plastering — other than for fire rating, waterproofing of wet areas, and sound insulation; or

 • painting — other than that required for weatherproofing an external wall.

When determining which form of evidence will be used, it is important to consider the appropriateness of the evidence,
as some forms of evidence may be more suitable to materials and products and others to designs and forms of
construction. The requirement to consider appropriateness of the evidence is specified in A5G2(1).


-----

###### A5G2 Evidence of suitability ─ Volumes One, Two and Three

[2019: A5.1]

(1) The form of evidence used must be appropriate to the use of the material, product, _plumbing_ _product, form of_
construction or design to which it relates.

(2) Any copy of documentary evidence submitted must be a complete copy of the original certificate, report or document.


**Explanatory Information**

For further guidance, refer to the ABCB Handbook for Evidence of Suitability.

All copies of documents provided as evidence must be unabridged copies of the originals. No part can be left incomplete.


###### A5G3 Evidence of suitability ─ Volumes One and Two (BCA)

[2019: A5.2]

(1) Subject to A5G5, A5G6, A5G7 and A5G9, evidence to support that the use of a material, product, form of construction
or design meets a Performance Requirement or a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision may be in the form of any one, or
any combination of the following:

(a) A current CodeMark Australia or CodeMark Certificate of Conformity.

(b) A current Certificate of Accreditation.

(c) A current certificate, other than a certificate described in (a) and (b), issued by a certification body stating that

the properties and performance of a material, product, form of construction or design fulfil specific requirements
of the BCA.

(d) A report issued by an Accredited Testing Laboratory that—

(i) demonstrates that a material, product or form of construction fulfils specific requirements of the BCA; and

(ii) sets out the tests the material, product or form of construction has been subjected to and the results of

those tests and any other relevant information that has been relied upon to demonstrate it fulfils specific
requirements of the BCA.

(e) A certificate or report from a professional engineer or other appropriately qualified person that—

(i) certifies that a material, product, form of construction or design fulfils specific requirements of the BCA; and

(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,

codes of practice or other publications have been relied upon to demonstrate it fulfils specific requirements
of the BCA.

(f) Another form of documentary evidence, such as but not limited to a Product Technical Statement, that—

(i) demonstrates that a material, product, form of construction or design fulfils specific requirements of the

BCA; and

(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,

codes of practice or other publications have been relied upon to demonstrate it fulfils specific requirements
of the BCA.

(2) Evidence to support that a calculation method complies with an ABCB protocol may be in the form of any one, or any
combination of the following:

(a) A certificate from a professional engineer or other appropriately qualified person that—

(i) certifies that the calculation method complies with a relevant ABCB protocol; and

(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,

codes of practice and other publications have been relied upon.

(b) Another form of documentary evidence that correctly describes how the calculation method complies with a

relevant ABCB protocol.


**Applications**


-----

**Notes**

Current documentary evidence, such as a certificate or report, containing references to NCC 2019 provisions remains
valid despite amended provision references in NCC 2022, subject to technical requirements remaining the same
between editions.


**Explanatory Information**

A5G3 represents the minimum level of documentary evidence needed to show that a material, product, form of
construction or design meets the relevant NCC requirements. The evidence can be required by:

###### • an appropriate authority;

 • a party to a construction contract; or

 • a person certifying compliance with the NCC.

If a building proponent does not produce exactly what is required, the evidence may be rejected.

It should be noted that ‘design’ may refer to engineering design, architectural design as well as product and material
design.

A5G3(1)(f) allows for the use of alternative forms of documentary evidence to those included in A5G3(1)(a) to (e), as
long as they comply with certain specified conditions.

An example of this arises when an authority carries out an inspection of a building site. The inspection alone would not
be acceptable as evidence. However, if the authority compiled a written report detailing findings and conclusions from
the inspection, then it may comply with the requirements of A5G3(1)(f).

A Product Technical Statement detailing the characteristics and merits of a particular product or system is also an
example of another form of documentary evidence.

There is significant reliance by industry on the use of calculation methods, including software programs, for
demonstrating compliance with the NCC. While there is no formal recognition of specific methods, A5G3(2) allows
suitable evidence to be submitted to demonstrate that a calculation method (including a software program) complies
with a relevant ABCB protocol that establishes the characteristics of a suitable calculation method.

If under a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision a building element is required to have an FRL, then A5G3 may be used to
provide evidence to show that the FRL has been determined in accordance with Specification 1 and 2.

In the case of a test report from an Accredited Testing Laboratory, the report may be either—

###### • the test report referred to in clause 2.16.2 of AS 1530.4 (also referred to as a full test report); or

 • the regulatory information report referred to in clause 2.16.3 of AS 1530.4 (also referred to as a short-form report).

In both cases the report must be an unabridged copy of the original report. A test certificate referred to in clause 2.16.4
of AS 1530.4 on its own is not suitable for showing compliance with the NCC.

If a proposal uses a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision that requires a building element to have fire hazard properties, then
A5G3 may be used to provide evidence to support the proposal and show that the fire hazard properties have been
determined in accordance with A5G6.

Refer to the guidance provided in the Guide to Volume One for further information on fire hazard properties which
includes—

###### • Flammability Index; and

 • Spread-of-Flame Index; and

 • Smoke-Developed Index; and

 • a material’s group number; and

 • smoke growth rate index.

The Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of the BCA contain a number of provisions requiring a ceiling to have a resistance
_to the incipient spread of fire to the space above itself. A5G7 sets out the method of determining the incipient spread_
of fire. The method is based on the method of determining the FRL of a building element and use of the Standard Fire
_Test._


-----

###### A5G4 Evidence of suitability ─ Volume Three (PCA)

[2019: A5.3]

(1) Any product that is intended for use in contact with drinking water must comply with the relevant requirements of
AS/NZS 4020, verified in the form of either—

(a) a test report provided by an Accredited Testing Laboratory, in accordance with AS/NZS 4020; or

(b) a WaterMark Licence issued in accordance with (3), if it includes compliance with AS/NZS 4020.

(2) Any product that contains copper alloy and is intended for use in contact with drinking water must have a weighted
_average lead content of not more than 0.25% verified in the form of either—_

(a) a test report provided by an Accredited Testing Laboratory, in accordance with NSF/ANSI/CAN 372; or

(b) a WaterMark Licence issued in accordance with (3), if it includes compliance with NSF/ANSI/CAN 372.

(3) A product of a type listed on the WaterMark Schedule of Products is deemed to be fit for its intended purpose if it has
a WaterMark Licence issued in accordance with the WaterMark Scheme Rules.

(4) A product of a type listed on the Watermark Schedule of Excluded Products requires evidence of suitability in the
form of—

(a) a current certificate issued by a certification body stating that the properties and performance of a product can

meet the requirements of the PCA; or

(b) a report issued by an Accredited Testing Laboratory that—

(i) demonstrates that the product complies with the relevant requirements of the PCA; and

(ii) sets out the tests the product has been submitted to and the results of those tests and any other relevant

information that has been relied upon to demonstrate suitability for use in a plumbing or drainage installation.

(5) Any product that is not covered by (3) or (4) must be subjected to a risk assessment in accordance with the WaterMark
Scheme Rules.

(6) Evidence to support that a design or system meets the relevant PCA Performance Requirements must be in the form
of any one or any combination of the following:

(a) The design or system complies with a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision.

(b) The design or system is a Performance Solution from a professional engineer or a recognised expert that—

(i) certifies that the design or system complies with the relevant requirements of the PCA; and

(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,

codes of practice or other publications have been relied upon.

(c) Any other form of documentary evidence that—

(i) demonstrates that a design or system complies with the relevant requirements of the PCA; and

(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,

codes of practice or other publications have been relied upon.

**Notes**

_On-site wastewater management systems larger than covered by the standards are exempt and a Performance Solution_
is required.


**Notes**

(1) A5G4(2) does not take effect until the completion of the transition period specified by WaterMark Notice of Direction

2021/4.

(2) Note 1 does not prevent the use of products certified in accordance with A5G4(2) prior to the completion of the


-----

**Applications**

_Products subject to the requirements of A5G4(2) are specifically nominated in the WaterMark Schedule of Products_
and the WaterMark Schedule of Excluded Products.


**Exemptions**

(1) _Products that are used exclusively for non-drinking uses such as manufacturing, industrial processing, irrigation or_

any other uses where water is not anticipated to be used for human consumption are excluded from the
requirements of A5G4(2).


**Explanatory Information**

Some examples of products subject to A5G4(2) include the following:

###### • Copper alloy fittings.

 • Stainless-steel braided hoses.

 • Valves (such as valves for isolation, backflow prevention, alteration of pressure and temperature).

 • Taps and mixers.

 • Water meters.

 • Pumps (for use with cold and heated water services).

 • Water heaters.

 • Residential water filtration equipment.

 • Water dispensers (such as boiling and cooling units, drinking fountains and bottle fillers).

 • Fire sprinkler systems connected to the cold water service that are not isolated from fixtures and fittings intended

to supply water for human consumption.

Some examples of products excluded from the requirements of A5G4(2) include the following:

###### • Shower heads for bathing.

 • Emergency showers, eye wash and/or face wash equipment.

 • Pumps used for irrigation, fire-fighting or other non-drinking water purposes.

 • Fire-fighting water services and equipment including residential fire sprinklers.

 • Appliances, including washing machines and dishwashers.

 • Commercial boilers associated with heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.

 • Sanitary fixtures (such as toilets, cistern inlet valves, bidets and urinals.

 • Non-drinking water systems (such as recycled water systems).

Product certification transition arrangements are outlined in Notices of Direction issued through the _WaterMark_
_Certification Scheme._

Lead is currently permitted in small proportions in the raw materials used to manufacture some plumbing _products._
Whilst the allowable lead levels permitted in products manufactured prior to 1 September 2025 ensures compliance
with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, the use of products compliant with the lead levels in A5G4(2) is
encouraged, to avoid the potential for adverse effects on human health.

A5G4(1) requires any product intended for use in contact with drinking water to comply with AS/NZS 4020. Compliance
is achieved by passing the relevant tests set out in the Standard.

Evidence of compliance must then be provided in accordance with A5G4(1), under which there are two options. The
first, at A5G4(1)(a), recognises test reports and certificates that cover compliance with AS/NZS 4020 only. The second,
at A5G4(1)(b), recognises WaterMark Licences where compliance with AS/NZS 4020 is a requirement of the relevant
_product Standard or WaterMark Technical Specification._

For products that are of a type listed on the WaterMark Schedule of Products, A5G4(2) requires that these products
have a _WaterMark Licence. A_ _WaterMark Licence reflects that the_ _product has been certified and authorised in_
accordance with the WaterMark Scheme Rules.


-----

support that the product is fit for its intended purpose is provided in A5G4(3). This may include demonstrating compliance
with a product specification referenced in the WaterMark Schedule of Excluded Products, where one is available.

A5G4(4) provides that any product that is not listed on the WaterMark Schedule of Products or the WaterMark Schedule
_of Excluded Products must be subjected to a risk assessment in accordance with the WaterMark Scheme Rules. The_
risk assessment will determine whether the product in question requires certification and authorisation, or if it should
be listed as an “excluded product”. This in turn will determine the form of evidence of suitability applicable to the product.

**Explanatory Information: What is WaterMark?**

The WaterMark Certification Scheme is a mandatory certification scheme for plumbing and drainage _products to ensure_
that these products are fit for purpose and appropriately authorised for use in a plumbing or drainage system.

The PCA, through Part A5, requires certain plumbing and drainage _products to be certified and authorised for use in a_
_plumbing or drainage system. These products are certified through the WaterMark Certification Scheme and listed on_
the WaterMark Product Database.

The WaterMark Certification Scheme is governed by the WaterMark Scheme Rules, which are available for download
from the ABCB website at: www.abcb.gov.au. These rules set out the requirements for risk assessments, evaluation,
certification, and the drafting of WaterMark Technical Specifications.

When a product is listed on the WaterMark Schedule of Products then, for it to be certified and authorised, the product
must—

###### • be tested by an Accredited Testing Laboratory; and

 • comply with an approved product specification (either a relevant existing product Standard or a WaterMark Technical

Specification); and

###### • be manufactured in accordance with an approved Quality Assurance Program; and

 • carry a scope of use.

_Products that comply fully with the applicable requirements of the WaterMark Certification Scheme are then eligible to_
be certified by a WaterMark Conformity Assessment Body and listed on the WaterMark Product Database. Certified
_products are identifiable by the WaterMark certification trade mark, shown in Figure A5G4 below, that must be displayed_
on the product upon granting of a WaterMark Licence.

with Specifications 1 and 2.

###### A5G6 Fire hazard properties

[2019: A5.5]

Where a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision requires a building component or assembly to have a fire hazard property it must
be determined as follows:

(a) For average specific extinction area, critical radiant flux and Flammability Index, as defined in Specification 1.


-----

(c) For a material’s group number or smoke growth rate index (SMOGRARC), in accordance with S7C4(2).

###### A5G7 Resistance to the incipient spread of fire

[2019: A5.6]

A ceiling is deemed to have a resistance to the incipient spread of fire to the space above itself if—

(a) it is identical with a prototype that has been submitted to the Standard Fire Test and the resistance to the incipient

_spread of fire achieved by the prototype is confirmed in a report from an Accredited Testing Laboratory that—_

(i) describes the method and conditions of the test and form of construction of the tested prototype in full; and

(ii) certifies that the application of restraint to the prototype complies with the Standard Fire Test; or

(b) it differs in only a minor degree from a prototype tested under (a) and the resistance to the incipient spread of

_fire attributed to the ceiling is confirmed in a report from an Accredited Testing Laboratory that—_

(i) certifies that the ceiling is capable of achieving the resistance to the incipient spread of fire despite the

minor departures from the tested prototype; and

(ii) describes the materials, construction and conditions of restraint that are necessary to achieve the resistance

_to the incipient spread of fire._

###### A5G8 Labelling of Aluminium Composite Panels

[2019: A5.7]

###### Introduction to this Part

The NCC groups buildings and structures by the purpose for which they are designed, constructed or adapted to be used,
assigning each type of building or structure with a classification. This Part explains how each building classification is
defined and used in the NCC.

The building classifications are labelled “Class 1” through to “Class 10”. Some classifications also have sub-classifications,
referred to by a letter after the number (e.g. Class 1a).

The technical building requirements for Class 2 to 9 buildings are mostly covered by Volume One of the NCC and those
for Class 1 and 10 are mostly covered by Volume Two of the NCC. Volume Three of the NCC covers plumbing and drainage
requirements for all building classifications.

A building may have parts that have been designed, constructed or adapted for different purposes. In most cases, each
of these parts is a separate classification. A building (or part of a building) may also have more than one such purpose
and may be assigned more than one classification.


###### Governing Requirements


###### A6G1 Determining a building classification

[2019: A6.0]

(1) The classification of a building or part of a building is determined by the purpose for which it is designed, constructed
or adapted to be used.

(2) Each part of a building must be classified according to its purpose and comply with all the appropriate requirements
for its classification.

(3) A room that contains a mechanical, thermal or electrical facility or the like that serves the building must have the
same classification as the major part or principal use of the building or fire compartment in which it is situated.

(4) Unless another classification is more suitable, an occupiable outdoor area must have the same classification as the
part of the building to which it is associated.


**Exemptions**

(1) For A6G1(1) where a part of a building has been designed, constructed or adapted for a different purpose and is

less than 10% of the floor area of the storey it is situated on, the classification of the other part of the storey may
apply to the whole storey.

(2) A6G1(3) does not apply to an electricity network substation.


**Limitations**

Exemption (1) does not apply where the minor use of a building is a laboratory, a Class 9b early childhood centre, or a
Class 2, 3 or 4 part of a building.


**Explanatory Information**

Classification is a process for understanding risks in a building or part, according to its use. It must be correctly
undertaken to achieve NCC aims as appropriate to each building in each circumstance.

It is possible for a single building to have parts with different classifications. Part of a building can also have more than
one classification. Where there is any conflict between what requirements the part should comply with, the more stringent
requirement applies.

Where it is unclear which classification should apply, appropriate authorities have the discretion to decide. They base
their decision on an assessment of the building proposal


-----

They will look at what classification the building most closely resembles. They will also take into account the likely fire
_load, plus, the likely consequences of any risks to the safety, health and amenity of people using the building._

_Appropriate authorities will also look at any relevant court decisions or determinations of the State or Territory body_
responsible for considering appeals on building classification matters.

It should be noted that appeals body determinations and, in some States and Territories, certain court decisions are
usually not precedent creating. Such decisions are determined on a case-by-case basis.

It should also be noted that State and Territory authorities responsible for building regulatory matters may have issued
advice, interpretations or guidelines to assist practitioners in applying the correct classification to a building or part.
Advice on such matters should be sought from the relevant authority.

Under Exemption (1) to A6G1, if 10% or less of the floor area of a storey is used for a purpose which could be classified
differently to the remainder of that storey, that part may be classified as being the same as the remainder. Laboratories,
_sole-occupancy units in Class 2, 3 or 4 parts, and Class 9b early childhood centres are excluded from this concession_
(see Limitation to A6G1). The reason is that laboratories are considered to have a high fire hazard potential and
classifying them with the remainder of the building could, in a majority of cases, endanger occupants of the other parts
of the building which have a lower fire hazard potential. In relation to Class 9b early childhood centres, the intent is to
ensure that these facilities cannot be regarded as another class and that the specific fire safety requirements applicable
to Class 9b early childhood centres are implemented. Also, the intent is not to allow sole-occupancy units in Class 2, 3
or 4 parts to be regarded as another Class such as Class 6 and then not have any fire or sound insulation between the
units and any other classification which may have a high fire load and could endanger the occupants of the Class 2, 3
or 4 part.

If Exemption (1) to A6G1 is used, it should be remembered that it will still be necessary to use the occupant numbers
in Volume One Table D2D18 for the particular use of the area. Likewise, the lighting and equipment levels, people
occupancy and load profiles for the area of minor use for the purposes of Volume One Section J must be in accordance
with the use of the area.

If the storey has a very large floor area, the 10% or less concession area may also be large, even though the rest of
the building is classifiable as a building which ordinarily has a lower risk potential. An example of the application of this
area concession could be as follows:

###### • If a single storey factory has an office that takes up 8% of the whole storey’s floor area, the entire building (including

the office) can be classified as being Class 8.

###### • However, if that office area takes up 12% of the storey’s floor area, that area must be classified as Class 5, and the

remainder of the building as Class 8.

Under A6G1(3) a plant room, machinery room, lift motor room or boiler room, have the same classification as the part
of the building they are in. These kinds of rooms do not need to be ancillary or subordinate to the part of the building
they are in, that is, the 10% criterion is not applicable.

There are specific provisions for these kinds of rooms. For example, Volume One Section C requires some of them to
be fire separated from the remainder of the building (e.g. see C3D14 with regard to elements of the electricity supply
system).


###### A6G2 Class 1 buildings

(1) A Class 1 building is a dwelling.

(2) Class 1 includes the following sub-classifications:

(a) Class 1a is one or more buildings, which together form a single dwelling including the following:

(i) A detached house.



[2019: A6.1]


(ii) One of a group of two or more attached dwellings, each being a building, separated by a fire-resisting wall,

including a row house, terrace house, town house or villa unit.

(b) Class 1b is one or more buildings which together constitute—

(i) a boarding house, guest house, hostel or the like that—

(A) would ordinarily accommodate not more than 12 people; and

(B) have a total area of all floors not more than 300 m[2] (measured over the enclosing walls of the building

b ildi )


-----

(ii) four or more single dwellings located on one allotment and used for short-term holiday accommodation.

-----

**Figure A6G2c:** **Domestic allotment — classification of buildings and structures**


**Notes**

Figures A6G2a, A6G2b and A6G2c illustrates requirements of this provision.


**Limitations**

For A6G2, a Class 1 building cannot be located above or below another dwelling or another class of building, other
than a private garage.


**Explanatory Information**

Class 1 buildings are primarily covered in Volumes Two and Three of the NCC. Class 1 buildings are not located above
or below another dwelling, or another class of building other than a private garage.

A sole-occupancy unit used for residential purposes located over another sole-occupancy unit used for residential
purposes will always be a Class 2 or Class 3 building (depending on the circumstances). It cannot be a Class 1 building.

A single Class 1 dwelling can be made up of more than one building. For example, it may include what is ordinarily
called a house, plus one or more habitable ‘outbuildings’ such as sleepouts. Note that a habitable building such as a
sleepout cannot be classified as a Class 10 building.

The height or number of storeys of a Class 1 building makes no difference to its classification.

Class 1b buildings used for short-term holiday accommodation include cabins in caravan parks, tourist parks, farm stay,
holiday resorts and similar tourist accommodation. This accommodation itself is typically rented out on a commercial
basis for short periods and generally does not require the signing of a lease agreement. Short-term accommodation
can also be provided in a boarding house, guest house, hostel, bed and breakfast accommodation or the like.

Unlike a Class 1b building described in A6G2(2)(a), a Class 1b building described in A6G2(2)(b) does not have any
_floor area limitation. Therefore, if 4 or more single dwellings are located on the one allotment and used for short-term_
holiday accommodation, each single dwelling would be classified as a Class 1b building regardless of the floor area of
each dwelling or the combined floor area of all of the dwellings.

See also Volume One D4D2(3) which contains an explanation of what is considered to be “one allotment”.

The Class 1b classification can attract concessions applicable to Class 3 buildings. These concessions allow people to
rent out rooms in a house, or run a bed and breakfast, without having to comply with the more stringent Class 3
requirements. The reasoning is that the smaller size of the building and its lower number of occupants represents


-----

Apart from their use, the primary difference between Class 1a and Class 1b buildings is that the latter is required to
have a greater number of smoke alarms and in some circumstances, access and features for people with a disability.

###### A6G3 Class 2 buildings

[2019: A6.2]

(1) A Class 2 building is a building containing two or more sole-occupancy units.

(2) Each sole-occupancy unit in a Class 2 building must be a separate dwelling.


**Explanatory Information**

A Class 2 building is one that includes more than one dwelling, each of which is generally solely occupied by one or
more people to the exclusion of others.

Such buildings must not be otherwise classified as a Class 1 or Class 3 building or Class 4 part. See Explanatory Figure
A6G3a for a typical configuration of Class 1 and Class 2 buildings.

Where a sole-occupancy residential unit is located above another sole-occupancy residential unit, the building containing
the units can be either a Class 2 or a Class 3 building, depending on the other circumstances of the building proposal.

Class 2 buildings can be single storey attached dwellings. Where there is any common space below such dwellings,
they are Class 2 (and cannot be Class 1) irrespective of whether the space below is a storey or not (see Explanatory
Figure A6G3b).

Class 2 buildings can be attached to buildings of another class. The attached Class 2 buildings need not be attached
to one another, and need not be more than a single storey.

When two or more dwellings are attached to another class, they cannot be Class 4 parts, as any building can only
contain one Class 4 dwelling.

###### A6G4 Class 3 buildings

[2019: A6.3]

(1) A Class 3 building is a residential building providing long-term or transient accommodation for a number of unrelated
persons.

(2) Class 3 buildings include the following:

(a) A boarding house, guest house, hostel, lodging house or backpacker accommodation.

(b) A residential part of a hotel or motel.

(c) A residential part of a school.

(d) Accommodation for the aged, children, or people with disability.

(e) A residential part of a health-care building which accommodates members of staff.

(f) A residential part of a detention centre.

(g) A residential care building.


**Limitations**

For A6G4, a Class 3 building is not a Class 1 or 2 building but may be a mixture of Class 3 and another class.


**Explanatory Information**

Class 3 buildings provide accommodation for unrelated people. The length of stay is unimportant.

Some exceptions to this classification include: certain bed and breakfast accommodation, boarding houses, guest
houses, hostels, or lodging houses and the like which fall within the concession provided for Class 1b buildings.

Also, any sized building can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if it is used to house any number of unrelated people
who jointly own or rent it, or share it on a non-rental basis with an owner or tenant.

It is not unusual for a manager’s, owner’s or caretaker’s dwelling attached to a Class 3 building to be thought of as a
Class 4 part of the Class 3 building. However, a Class 4 part of a building can only be part of a Class 5-9 building.

Accordingly, such dwellings are either classified as Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3, depending on the circumstances of the
building proposal. However, a building could be a mixture of Class 3 and another class.

Class 3 buildings include—

###### • the residential parts of hotels and motels; and

h t l t l t k ’ ’ ’ fl t ti th t d t i i t h d lli ld


-----

be Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3 buildings; and



###### • dormitory accommodation, in schools or elsewhere, noting that a dormitory is generally (but not always) considered

to be a sole-occupancy unit; and

###### • bed and breakfast accommodation, a boarding house, guest house, hostel, or lodging house; and

 • backpackers’ accommodation; and

 • a building which houses elderly people or other people who require special care (in some States or Territories it is

not acceptable for a Class 1b building to be used to house elderly people or other people who require special care

  - it is recommended the local building regulatory body be consulted); and

###### • workers’ quarters, including shearers’ or fruit pickers’ accommodation, or hotel workers’ accommodation.


###### A6G5 Class 4 buildings

Class 4 is a dwelling in a Class 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 building if it is the only dwelling in the building.



[2019: A6.4]


**Explanatory Information**

Class 4 classification applies to some types of accommodation located within a Class 5-9 building. The most common
include a caretaker’s flat within a building; and accommodation over or otherwise connected to a shop.

A Class 4 part cannot be located within a Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3 building. There can only be one Class 4 dwelling
in a building. If there are two or more dwellings, they are Class 1, Class 2, or possibly Class 3. These Class 1, Class 2
or Class 3 parts need not be attached to one another, nor be more than a single storey.

Where a Class 4 part of a building is rented out for accommodation purposes, it retains its Class 4 classification.
However, if any other part of the principal building is used for accommodation, for example, the attached shop is
converted into an additional flat, both flats become classifiable as Class 2 or, depending on their use, possibly Class 3.


###### A6G6 Class 5 buildings

A Class 5 building is an office building used for professional or commercial purposes.



[2019: A6.5]


**Explanatory Information**

Class 5 buildings include professional chambers or suites, lawyers’ offices, government offices, advertising agencies
and accountants’ offices.


_NSW A6G7_

_SA A6G7_

###### A6G7 Class 6 buildings

[2019: A6.6]

(1) A Class 6 building is a shop or other building used for the sale of goods by retail or the supply of services direct to
the public.

(2) Class 6 buildings include the following:

(a) An eating room, cafe, restaurant, milk or soft-drink bar.

(b) A dining room, bar area that is not an assembly building, shop or kiosk part of a hotel or motel.

(c) A hairdresser’s or barber’s shop, public laundry, or undertaker’s establishment.

(d) A supermarket or sale room, showroom, or service station.


-----

**Explanatory Information**

A Class 6 building is a building where goods or services are directly sold or supplied to the public. Examples of a Class
6 building may include—

###### • a place where food or drink may be purchased such as a café or restaurant; or

 • a dining room, bar area that is not an assembly building, shop or kiosk part of a hotel or motel; or

 • a hairdresser’s or barber’s shop, public laundry, veterinarian; or

 • supermarket or sale room, florist, showroom, or service station.

_Service stations are Class 6 buildings. These are outlets used for the servicing of cars and the selling of fuel or other_
goods. The expression ‘service station’ is not intended to cover buildings where panel beating, auto electrical, muffler
replacement, tyre replacement and the like are solely carried out. Such buildings should be classified as Class 6, Class
7 or Class 8 buildings as the appropriate authority sees fit.


###### A6G8 Class 7 buildings

(1) A Class 7 building is a storage-type building.

(2) Class 7 includes the following sub-classifications:

(a) Class 7a — a carpark.



[2019: A6.7]


(b) Class 7b — a building that is used for storage, or display of goods or produce for sale by wholesale.


**Explanatory Information**

There are three basic types of Class 7 building. The first is a carpark as defined in the NCC. The second is a building
used for storage, often referred to as a ‘warehouse’. The third is a building used for the display of goods or produce for
sale by wholesale. ‘Wholesale’ means sale to people in the trades or in the business of ‘on-selling’ goods and services
to another party (including the public).


###### A6G9 Class 8 buildings

(1) A Class 8 building is a process-type building.

(2) Class 8 buildings include the following:

(a) A laboratory.



[2019: A6.8]


(b) A building in which the production, assembling, altering, repairing, packing, finishing, or cleaning of goods or

produce for sale takes place.


**Explanatory Information**

The most common way to describe a Class 8 building is as a ‘factory’. However, this can give a simplistic impression
of the types of building which can fall within this classification.

For example—

###### • some laboratories, despite their often small size, have been included as Class 8 buildings principally because of

their high fire hazard; and

###### • buildings used for altering or repairing (except service stations, which are specifically included in A6G7 as Class 6

buildings); and

###### • potteries; and

 • food manufacturers (but not restaurants, which are specifically included in A6G7 as Class 6 buildings); and

 • buildings used for the packing or processing of produce, such as a farm or horticultural building.


-----

###### A6G10 Class 9 buildings

(1) A Class 9 building is a building of a public nature.

(2) Class 9 includes the following sub-classifications:



[2019: A6.9]


(a) Class 9a — a health-care building including any parts of the building set aside as laboratories, and includes a

_health-care building used as a residential care building._

(b) Class 9b — an assembly building including a trade workshop or laboratory in a primary or secondary school.

(c) Class 9c — a residential care building.


**Exemptions**

A6G10(2)(b) excludes any parts of the building that are of another Class.


**Explanatory Information**

Class 9a buildings are health-care buildings, including day-care surgeries or procedure units and the like. See definition
of health-care building. Laboratories that are part of a Class 9a building are Class 9a, despite the general classification
of laboratories as Class 8 buildings.

Class 9b buildings are assembly buildings.

These buildings can include—

###### • theatres, cinemas and halls, churches, schools, early childhood centres, kindergartens, preschools and child
minding centres; and

###### • indoor cricket, tennis, basketball centres and sport stadiums; and

 • nightclubs, discotheques, bar areas providing live entertainment and/or containing a dance floor, public halls, dance

halls and other places of entertainment; and

###### • snooker halls; and

 • bus and railway stations.

Regarding the Exemption to A6G10(2)(b), a building could be a mixture of Class 9b and another class, or a Class 9b
building could contain parts that are of another class, but be taken as a Class 9b building because of Exemption (1) to
A6G1.

Class 9c buildings are residential care buildings that may contain residents who have various care level needs.

The Class 9c classification recognises that many residents progress through a continuum of care needs from low to
high. Many older people enter residential care with low care needs (typically Class 3 facilities) but, as they age, require
higher levels of care. In the past, such progression often necessitated the transfer of a hostel resident (Class 3) to a
nursing home (Class 9a). This frequently had negative consequences for the health and well-being of the resident, for
whom the hostel accommodation was home. It also led, at times, to the separation of couples with differing care needs.

Building designers should note that Class 3 buildings include hostels for the accommodation of the aged, and Class 9a
buildings include nursing homes. It is important to be aware, however, that construction of Class 3 or 9a buildings may
restrict the options available to the operators of a facility in relation to the profile of the residents they wish to
accommodate. Where the potential exists for residents of varying care needs to be accommodated, consideration of
the Class 9c provisions may be appropriate. The Class 9c classification allows for any mix of low and high care residents
and is intended to allow the mix to change as the residents’ care needs change over time, without the need to obtain
any further consent or approval from the appropriate authority.

Multi-care level facilities are for residents who may require the full range of care services outlined by the Aged Care
Act. Hence, it is not intended to restrict the resident type and provides maximum flexibility for service providers, residents
and the community.

The NCC provisions for Class 9c buildings are based on minimal on duty on-site staff being available at any time.
However, it is recognised that the staff numbers vary throughout the course of any one day, due to the care needs of
the residents and the functioning of the facility. It is also recognised that the specific care needs of the residents may
result in a greater minimum number of staff.


-----

###### A6G11 Class 10 buildings and structures

(1) A Class 10 building is a non-habitable building or structure.

(2) Class 10 includes the following sub-classifications:

(a) Class 10a is a non-habitable building including a private garage, carport, shed or the like.



[2019: A6.10]


(b) Class 10b is a structure that is a fence, mast, antenna, retaining wall or free-standing wall or swimming pool or

the like.

(c) Class 10c is a private bushfire shelter.


**Explanatory Information**

Class 10a buildings are non-habitable buildings. See Explanatory Figure A6G11 for an indication of some Class 10
building configurations.

Class 10b structures are non-habitable structures. There is no requirement for Class 10 buildings to be appurtenant to
a building of any other Class, for example, a small shed standing on its own on an allotment and a toilet block in a park.

A habitable ‘outbuilding’ which is appurtenant to another building is generally part of that building. Again, habitable
‘outbuildings’ cannot be classified as Class 10 buildings.

Typical outbuilding classifications include the following:

###### • A sleepout on the same allotment as a Class 1 building is part of the Class 1 building.

 • A detached entertainment room on the same allotment as a Class 1 building, perhaps associated with a swimming

_pool, is part of the Class 1 building._

###### • A small toolshed, used for trade-related hobbies for non-commercial purposes or home repairs, on the same

allotment as a Class 1 building, would be classified as a Class 10 building.

Provisions relating to Class 10c structures are only intended to address private bushfire shelters associated with a
single Class 1a dwelling. These provisions are contained in Volume Two of the NCC.

Some States or Territories may exempt some Class 10 buildings or structures (often on the basis of height or size) from
the need to have a building permit. Queries on this matter should be referred to the State or Territory body responsible
for regulatory matters.

###### A6G12 Multiple classifications

[2019: A6.11]

A building (or part of a building) may be designed, constructed or adapted for multiple purposes and have more than one
classification.


**Applications**

For A6G12, a building (or part of a building) must comply with all the relevant requirements that apply to each of the
classifications for that building (or part of a building).


**Explanatory Information: Difficult classifications — Class 2 or Class 3?**

There is a fine line between a Class 2 building containing apartments or flats and a Class 3 motel building with units
containing bathroom, laundry and cooking facilities, which may both be made available for short term holiday rental.
When does a Class 3 motel unit become a Class 2 holiday flat and vice versa?

In general, an assessment will be based on the most likely use of the building by appropriate authorities.

Class 3 buildings, where the occupants are generally unfamiliar with the building and have minimum control over the
safety of the building, represent a higher risk level and therefore require higher safety levels. In a case where the
classification is unclear, a decision should be made according to the perceived risks inherent in the use of the building.


**Explanatory Information: Difficult classifications — Class 6 or Class 7?**

Class 7 buildings include those used to sell goods on the wholesale market, whereas Class 6 buildings are used to sell
goods to the public.

Some establishments claim to sell goods to both the wholesale and retail markets. As a rule, however, if the general
public has access to the building, it is considered a ‘shop’, and therefore a Class 6 building.


**Explanatory Information: Difficult classifications — Hotel bars: Class 6 or 9b?**

As can be seen from the definition of a Class 6 building, it includes a hotel bar which is not an assembly building. The
bar includes the bar area and associated standing and seating areas. This clarifies that the bar extends beyond the
serving area to include standing and sitting areas where patrons may drink alcohol or other beverages and consume
food. The exclusion of an assembly building means that a bar providing live entertainment or containing a dance floor
is not considered to be Class 6; it must be considered as Class 9b. However, when that use is minor compared with the
remainder of the bar, such as a piano bar or the like where patrons only listen to music and there is no dance floor, the
_appropriate authority should exercise judgement on the predominant use and therefore the appropriate classification of_
the bar.

A Class 9b building is an assembly building which is defined to include a building where people may assemble for
entertainment, recreational or sporting purposes.

A building may have more than one classification (see A6G12).


**Explanatory Information: Buildings used for farming purposes**

Buildings used for farming-type purposes are often very diverse in nature, occupancy, use and size. In some States or
Territories, appropriate authorities may classify farm buildings as Class 10a, which covers non-habitable buildings. They
would only make this decision if a classification of Class 7 or Class 8 would not be more appropriate.

When making their decision they consider the building’s size, purpose, operations and the extent to which people are
employed in the building. For example, it may be appropriate to classify a shed which is used to store a tractor as a
Class 10a building.

The NCC has definitions of farm building and farm shed which are certain Class 7 and 8 buildings used for farming
purposes. Concessions to specific Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions apply to farm buildings and farm sheds in recognition
of their often low risk features, and it is recommended that reference is made to the definitions of farm building and
_farm shed for further guidance which may assist determination of an appropriate NCC classification._

For example, if people are likely to be employed to stack materials/produce in a storage building or remove
materials/produce from a storage building then a classification of Class 7b may be appropriate Depending upon whether


-----

the criteria in the definition of farm shed or farm building have been met, the associated Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions
in NCC Volume One Part I3 may apply.

Similarly if people are likely to be employed to pack or process materials/produce within a building, or employed to
feed, clean or collect produce from animals or plants within a building then a classification of Class 8 may be appropriate.
Depending upon whether the criteria in the definition of farm shed or farm building have been met, the associated
_Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions in NCC Volume One Part I3 may apply._

However identification of low fire load, low occupant risk and low risk of fire spread should not be used as justification
for choosing a less stringent building classification for a building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions. For example,
if the intended use of a building is to grow or store a large amount of tomatoes, such as a large greenhouse, and there
is likely to be only one to two persons in the building at any time, it is considered inappropriate to classify the building
as a Class 10a under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions and a classification of Class 7 or Class 8 would be more
appropriate.

The Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for a Class 7 or Class 8 farm building or farm shed do not prevent the ability to
consider or develop a Performance Solution for a particular building where the requirements may not be considered
appropriate or are viewed as too stringent. Similarly if a Class 7 or 8 building used for farming purposes does not meet
all the criteria to be considered a farm building or farm shed under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, this would not
limit the ability to develop a Performance Solution which could contain features similar to those allowed under the
_Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for farm buildings or farm sheds._

For example, if a Class 8 commercial poultry building meets all the criteria to be considered a farm building under the
_Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions other than the maximum floor area criteria, a Performance Solution could be developed_
to demonstrate that the concessions for a farm building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions are appropriate.

In regards to a farm building or farm shed where the purpose of the building is to park farm vehicles when not in use,
as well as perhaps clean or polish the vehicle(s), it may be appropriate that this type of building is classified as a Class
7a.

However, a number of farm buildings and farm sheds are often not only used for the storage of farm vehicles, but to
store supplies such as fuel, grain or hay. A Class 7a classification may still be appropriate where the majority of the
shed’s space is intended to be designated for the parking of vehicles. However, it may be more appropriate to classify
some types of buildings as Class 7b, rather than Class 7a where a mixed use shed is intended.

Under A6G12 each part of a building (including the entire building) may have more than one classification. This means,
for example, that it is permissible to classify part of a building as a Class 6/7 building, or a Class 5/6 building, or whatever
is appropriate.

It is expected that this approach may be taken by a builder who is uncertain of what the precise use of a building will
be after its sale, or to maximise the flexibility of the building’s use.

Under the Application to A6G12, where a building has more than one classification the more stringent Class
requirements will apply.

###### Introduction to this Part

This Part explains how multiple buildings can be considered as a united building. Where adjacent buildings are joined
through openings in walls, they need not meet additional requirements if they jointly comply with the NCC as a single
building.


###### Governing Requirements


###### A7G1 United buildings

[2019: A7.0]

Buildings are deemed united when two or more buildings adjoining each other are connected and used as one building.


**Applications**

(1) For A7G1, two or more buildings are a united building if they are connected through openings in the walls dividing

them and together comply with all the requirements of the NCC as though they are a single building.

(2) A7G1 only applies to Class 2 to 9 buildings.


###### A7G2 Alterations in a united building

[2019: A7.1]

If, after alterations or any other building work, two or more of the buildings in A7G1 cease to be connected through openings
in the dividing walls, each of those buildings not now connected must comply with all the requirements for a single building.


**Explanatory Information**

It is not unusual for authorities to receive plans proposing the connecting of two or more buildings. Connecting buildings
could be achieved by breaking openings through walls, or by joining the buildings by a tunnel, bridge or covered walkway.

When connected, if the buildings jointly comply with all the requirements of the NCC applying as if they were a single
building, they become a united building.

United buildings are not required to comply with additional NCC provisions. For example, any new openings do not
require any form of fire protection not required of a single building.

Note, however, an external wall, which as a result of an interconnection becomes an internal wall, must comply with the
requirements for an internal wall.

Interconnected buildings that do not jointly comply with all the requirements applicable to a single building, remain as
separate buildings.

This raises the possible need for fire doors, or other forms of protection to be fitted to connecting openings.


**Explanatory Information: Multiple allotments or ownership**

The NCC does not concern itself with actually prohibiting or permitting the uniting of buildings in separate ownership or
on separate allotments. Such matters are dealt with by the relevant local bodies.


**Explanatory Information: Example of connection by bridge**

In this example, Building A is connected to Building B by bridge C. There are four different options for designing such
a proposal.


-----

A, B and C are considered as a single structure and comply with the NCC.


The second is three separate buildings:

A, B and C are a fire-source feature to each of the others, and are separated by fire walls with the openings protected
at the points of connection. In this case, C may require independent support and separate egress to a road or open
space, that is not through Buildings A or B. In this case, attention should also be paid to the length of the bridge, as
regards distance of travel to an exit.

The third option is the bridge as a portion of Building A:

In this option, A and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. B is a
separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire-doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be
supported off Building A, but not off Building B.

The fourth option is having the bridge as a portion of Building B:

In this option, B and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. A is a
separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be
supported off Building B, but not off Building A.

In some cases, C will link A and B across a public road, including laneways and the like. Special approvals may be
required from various appropriate authorities. However, in such cases—

###### • if C is supported by means other than off A and B, such support will generally only be permitted if there is no

obstruction of the public road; and

###### • care will need to be taken in calculating the distance of travel to an exit if travel is required to be over C and the

road is wide; and

###### • fire-separation may be necessary at each end of the bridge.

If the last stipulation is the case, the following matters need consideration:

###### • The bridge would probably need to be of fire-rated construction because combustible construction could provide a

ready path for the transfer of fire, and non-combustible construction could, in a major fire, distort and collapse onto
the road.

###### • The designer needs to take care that the bridge does not negate the fire separation between the storeys of the

building.

###### Verification Methods


###### H1V1 Structural reliability

[2019: V2.1.1]

(1) This Verification Method is only applicable to components with a resistance coefficient of variation of at least 10%
and not more than 40%.

(2) For components with a calculated resistance coefficient of variation value less than 10%, then a minimum value of
10% should be used.

(3) Compliance with H1P1(1), (2) and (3) is verified for the design of a structural component for strength when—


(a) the capacity reduction factor  satisfies   � _Average �G�Q�W �����_, where G�Q�W ���� are capacity reduction

factors for all relevant actions and must contain at least permanent (G), imposed (Q) and wind (W) actions; and

(b) the capacity reduction factors G�Q�W ���� are calculated for target reliability indices for permanent action TG,

(E) _VS_ = coefficient of variation of the appropriate action as given in Table H1V1a; and


(F) _VR = coefficient of variation of the resistance; and_

(G) [ = appropriate load factor as given in AS/NZS 1170.0; and ]


(H) [ = capacity factor for the appropriate action; and ]

(c) the annual target reliability indices TG�TQ�TW ���� are established as follows:


(i) For situations where it is appropriate to compare with an equivalent Deemed-to-Satisfy product, a resistance

model must be established for the equivalent Deemed-to-Satisfy product and TG�TQ�TW must be

calculated for the equivalent Deemed-to-Satisfy product in accordance with the equation given at (b)

**Table Notes**

(1) Table H1V1b is applicable for components that exhibit brittle failure similar to concrete as specified in AS 3600.

(2) For components with creep characteristics similar to timber as specified in AS 1720.1, the target reliability index

for permanent action shall be increased to 5.0.

(3) The above target reliability indices are based on materials or systems that exhibit creep or brittle failure

characteristics similar to timber and concrete.

(4) Table H1V1b may also be applicable to materials or systems that exhibit creep or brittle failure differently to steel,

timber or concrete provided that the creep and/or brittle nature of the material or system are properly accounted for
in the design model.

(5) The above target reliability indices are also applicable for materials or systems that exhibit ductile failure

characteristics.


###### H1V2 Structural robustness

(1) Compliance with H1P1(1)(c) is verified for structural robustness if (2) and (3) are complied with.



[2019: V2.1.2]


(2) The structure is assessed such that the building remains stable and the resulting collapse does not extend further
than the immediately adjacent storeys upon the notional removal in isolation of—

(a) any supporting column; or

(b) any beam supporting one or more columns; or


-----

(3) It is demonstrated that if a supporting structural component is relied upon to carry more than 25% of the total structure,
a systematic risk assessment of the building is undertaken and critical high risk components are identified and
designed to cope with the identified hazard or protective measures chosen to minimise the risk.


**Explanatory Information**

H1V2 is a means to verify structural robustness of a building or structure in order to meet the requirements of H1P1(1)(c).
For further guidance, refer to the ABCB Handbook for Structural Robustness.


###### Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions


###### H1D1 Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions

[New for 2022]

(1) Where a Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution is proposed, Performance Requirements H1P1 and H1P2 are satisfied by
complying with H1D2 to H1D11.

(2) Where a _Performance Solution is proposed, the relevant_ _Performance Requirements must be determined in_
accordance with A2G2(3) and A2G4(3) as applicable.

###### H1D2 Structural provisions

[2019: 3.0.1]

A Class 1 or Class 10 building must be constructed in accordance with—

(a) Section 2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions; or

(b) the relevant provisions of H1D3 to H1D12; or

(c) any combination thereof.

###### H1D3 Site preparation

[2019: 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.4]

(1) _Performance Requirement_ H1P1 is satisfied for earthworks associated with the construction of a building or structure
if they are in accordance with Part 3.2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions, provided that the site is classified as A, S,
M, H or E in accordance with 4.2.2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions and the work is undertaken in normal site
conditions.

(2) _Performance Requirement_ H1P1 is satisfied for an earth retaining structure associated with the construction of a
building or structure if it is designed and constructed in accordance with AS 4678.

_QLD H1D3(3)_

(3) Compliance with Part 3.4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions satisfies Performance Requirement H1P1 for termite risk
management.


**Explanatory Information: “Normal” site conditions**

“Normal” site conditions relates to parameters such as—

###### • the site conditions not being significantly modified by the removal of previous buildings or other structures; and

 • the moisture conditions on site being as a result of seasonal and climatic changes; and

 • the site conditions not being subject to unusual moisture conditions caused by drains, dams, channels, ponds or

tanks which are to be maintained or removed; and

###### • large trees have not been recently removed from the site in the area where the building is to be constructed; and

 • other similar matters.


-----

**Explanatory Information: Earth retaining structures**

AS 4678 contains requirements for earth retaining structures between 800 mm and 15 m in height, and does not apply
to structures which are founded in exceptional site conditions (e.g. landslips), are subjected to sustained cyclic loading
or are used for the purposes of water-retaining (e.g. dams and reservoirs).

It should be noted that H1D3(2) is only one way of achieving compliance with H1P1. Other ways of complying include
the following:

###### • The relevant structural design provisions referenced in H1D2.

 • The relevant provisions of other Parts of the ABCB Housing Provisions relating to earth retaining structures.

 • A Performance Solution that uses one of the other NCC Assessment Methods which verifies that compliance with

H1P1 will be achieved.

**Explanatory Information**

For the purposes of H1D6(2), design requirements for other materials used in combination with steel or timber framing,
including the use of concrete floors, structural steel support beams, etc. are described in the following locations within


-----

###### • Section 2 for structural provisions.



###### • Part 6.3 for structural steel members.

The weight of roof or ceiling insulation, particularly if additional ceiling insulation is used for compliance with the energy
efficiency provisions, needs to be considered in the selection of plasterboard, plasterboard fixings and building framing.

For the purposes of H1D6(3) and (4):

###### • Information on design wind speeds for particular areas may be available from the appropriate authority.

 • A map indicating cyclonic regions of Australia is contained in Part 2.2.

 • There are certain limitations on the application to domestic structures such as Class 1a and 1b buildings in Appendix

A of AS 1170.4. These limitations include building height, roof slope, etc. For additional information refer to Appendix
A of AS 1170.4.

H1D6(7) does not apply where a software package simply eliminates manual calculations and the process of the
package requires identical methodology as that undertaken manually, e.g. AS 1684 span tables and bracing calculations.

The application of Part 6.3 of the ABCB Housing Provisions requires all loads to be distributed evenly unless they are
noted otherwise or allowed for within the construction and placement of relevant building elements. Part 6.3 of the
ABCB Housing Provisions allows for point loads to be applied to strutting beams only if the loads are located within the
middle third of the beam’s span. In any other case, designs should be carried out in accordance with either H1D6(5)(a)
or (b), or by a suitably qualified practitioner.


**Explanatory Information: Explanation of first dimension of steel section installed vertically**

H1D6(6) provides that Part 6.3 of the ABCB Housing Provisions satisfies Performance Requirement H1P1 with respect
to structural stability, strength and deflection if the ‘first dimension’ of a steel section is installed vertically.

For example, a 150 x 90 x 8 UA is used as a structural steel member (lintel) to support masonry over an opening.

The “first dimension” designated is 150 mm (b1) and is the vertical leg that resists bending loads over the width of the
opening. This leg must be installed in the vertical plane.

The 90 mm (b2) designation refers to the horizontal leg that rests under the masonry elements and transfers direct
loads to the extremities of the opening while the 8 mm (t) designation refers to the thickness of the steel section.

A 150 x 90 x 8 UA is designated as follows:

###### • 150 = leg length (b1)

 • 90 = leg length (b2)

 • 8 = thickness (t)

These designations are depicted in Explanatory Figure H1D6.

**Explanatory Information**

The requirements of H1D7(2)(a)(ii) must be read in conjunction with the provisions of AS/NZS 1170.2. The ABCB
commissioned research to establish a nationally consistent testing regime for metal roof cladding assemblies in cyclonic
areas. The results of this research are contained in H1D7(2)(a)(ii).

Low cycle fatigue cracking of metal roof cladding elements during tropical cyclones is a complex process where small
changes in load, geometry or material properties can significantly affect the fatigue performance of the cladding system
(includes immediate supports, fixings and cladding). The consequences of failure of an element can quickly lead to
more elements progressively failing. These failed elements become wind driven debris and so pose a threat to people
and other structures as potential missiles.

If a system does not successfully resist the fatigue loading sequence in Table H1D7, it does not comply. The test section
consists of cladding elements, fastenings and immediate supporting members assembled together in a manner identical
to those parts of the particular roof which the test section is intended to replicate.

(ii) removing parts of the wall cladding so that the waling plate is directly fixed to the external wall, with—

(A) the junction of the waling plate and the external wall flashed in accordance with clause 12.3.3 of the

ABCB Housing Provisions; and

(B) the cladding restored to its original strength by installing blocking supports as necessary on completion

of installation; and

(l) the deck or balcony is braced to prevent lateral movement in accordance with clause 12.3.4 of the ABCB Housing

Provisions.


**Explanatory Information**

A 2 kPa imposed load is commensurate with domestic and residential activities associated with Class 1 buildings (e.g.
dwellings with limited occupancy and restricted public access) and is not appropriate for applications where the deck
or balcony supports heavy equipment, spa/bathing pools or circumstances where the deck or balcony is intended for
community access (e.g. applications with a mid-high occupancy and possibility of public access).

If the design live load of the deck or balcony is more than 2 kPa, the framing members of the deck or balcony must be
designed by a professional engineer or other appropriately qualified person in accordance with the relevant structural
design manuals in Part 2.2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions.

H1D11(k)(ii) requires consideration to be given to restoring cladding, weatherproofing and structural properties. Other
considerations include restoring the appropriate sound and thermal insulation, and the capacity to maintain an FRL
where required.

H1D11 describes the circumstances under which the methods of attachment described in this Part are deemed
appropriate.

Where a deck or balcony is constructed outside the conditions listed in H1D11, e.g. attachment to a masonry veneer
wall, the method of attachment to the building or structure must be designed by a professional engineer or other
_appropriately qualified person in accordance with the relevant structural design manuals in Part 2.2 of the ABCB Housing_
Provisions. Such a design will need to consider the suitability of the wall to withstand the loads imposed by the deck or
balcony, and the capacity of the connections.

Examples of external wall construction that are outside the application of H1D11 include a masonry external wall that
is not fully core-filled, cavity masonry and masonry veneer construction where fasteners may be subject to withdrawal.

An alternative to attaching a deck or balcony directly to an external wall includes providing supporting piers, posts or
columns or the like parallel to the wall line or at right angles to the wall.


###### H1D12 Piled footings

[3.2.0]

_Performance Requirement_ H1P1 is satisfied for piled footings if they are designed and installed in accordance with AS
2159.


**Explanatory Information**

Slab construction—design requirements for other elements of construction that may be used in combination with the
above piled footing systems, including concrete slabs, etc. are described in H1D2 for Structural provisions and H1D4
for Footings and slabs.

-----

can be susceptible to potential for water ingress into a building and causing damage. Therefore, careful consideration
should be given to the design, construction and the materials used to minimise the potential for water ingress to spaces
below.

H2D8 prescribes external waterproofing requirements for buildings, and references AS 4654 Parts 1 and 2 that provide
solutions for liquid and/or sheet membrane roofing systems on flat roofs, roof terraces, balconies and terraces located
over habitable rooms. The term flat roof is commonly used to describe a near flat roof with enough pitch to provide
drainage for rainwater.

AS 4654.1 sets out the requirements for materials forming part of a waterproofing system and AS 4654.2 sets out design
and construction/installation requirements.

A Performance Solution in accordance with A2G2 would need to be provided for other types of external waterproofing
materials and designs.

###### H3D4 Fire protection of separating walls and floors

[2019: 3.7.3]

Compliance with Part 9.3 of the ABCB Housing Provisions satisfies Performance Requirement H3P1 for fire protection of
_separating walls and floors._

_NSW H3D5_

###### H3D5 Fire separation of garage-top-dwellings

[2019: 3.7.4]

Compliance with Part 9.4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions satisfies Performance Requirement H3P1 for fire separation of
garage-top dwellings.

###### H3D6 Smoke alarms and evacuation lighting

[2019: 3.7.5]

(1) Compliance with Part 9.5 of the ABCB Housing Provisions satisfies Performance Requirement H3P2 for smoke alarms
and evacuation lighting.

(2) For the purposes of (1), a Class 1 building includes a Class 10a private garage located above or below the Class 1
building.


**Explanatory Information: Smoke alarms general requirements**

_Performance Requirement_ H3P2 and the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of Part 9.5 of the ABCB Housing Provisions
require automatic warning on the detection of smoke in buildings, so that occupants may be alerted to a fire in order to
evacuate to a place of safety.


**Explanatory Information: Different smoke alarm requirements for Class 1a and Class 1b buildings**

Part 9.5 of the ABCB Housing Provisions specifies different smoke alarm requirements for Class 1a and Class 1b
buildings. The main difference is that a Class 1b building is required to have a greater number of smoke alarms, i.e.
smoke alarms must be installed in all bedrooms, and a system of lighting must be installed to assist evacuation. This
is due to Class 1b buildings generally being used for more transient purposes and the occupants being less familiar
with the building layout.


**Explanatory Information: Smoke alarms complying with AS 3786**

Clause 9.5.1(b) of the ABCB Housing Provisions requires a smoke alarm(s) to comply with AS 3786. AS 3786 contains
the requirements for the design and performance of electrically operated smoke alarms containing both detection and
alarm facilities. Types of smoke alarms prescribed in AS 3786 include photoelectric, ionisation or a combination of the
two.


**Explanatory Information: Smoke alarms to be connected to consumer mains source**

Clause 9.5.1(c) of the ABCB Housing Provisions requires that a smoke alarm be connected to the consumer mains
electricity source where a consumer mains source is supplied to the building. A smoke alarm complying with AS 3786,
that is intended for connection to an external power source, is required to be provided with a secondary power source
i.e. a source of power to supply the smoke alarm in the event that the primary power source is unavailable. Generally,
the requirement is met by providing mains powered smoke alarms with a battery back-up.


**Explanatory Information: Interconnection of smoke alarms**

Clause 9.5.1(d) of the ABCB Housing Provisions requires that alarms be interconnected to provide a common alarm so
that if one alarm in the dwelling activates, the other alarms automatically activate, which will increase the likelihood of
sleeping occupants becoming aware of the detection of smoke. Alarms of a Class 1 building need not be interconnected
with alarms in another Class 1 building or a private garage which does not belong to the Class 1 building


-----

**Explanatory Information: Location of smoke alarms**

When deciding on the position of smoke alarms it is important to remember that they are intended to detect smoke
before it reaches the sleeping occupants of a building.

The ensuing alarm is designed to wake the occupants and give them time to evacuate the building.


**Explanatory Information: Smoke alarms required on other storeys not containing bedrooms**

In addition to a smoke alarm being required to be provided on storeys containing bedrooms, a smoke alarm is also
_required on each other storey that is not already provided with a smoke alarm even if those storeys consist of only_
carparking, bathrooms, laundries and the like. “Storey” in this context differs from the definition contained in the NCC
which excludes such spaces from being considered as storeys.

Reference to “storey” only applies within a single dwelling. For example, if a storey contains a private garage belonging
to the Class 1a dwelling in addition to a private garage which does not belong to the Class 1a dwelling, smoke alarms
must be installed in both private garages.

Where the other storey is a Class 10a private garage, clause 9.5.1(b) of the ABCB Housing Provisions permits the use
of any other alarm deemed suitable in accordance with AS 1670.1 provided smoke alarms complying with AS 3786 are
installed elsewhere in the Class 1 building.


**Explanatory Information: Nuisance alarms**

Smoke alarms are extremely sensitive and may detect smoke and moisture created by common household activities
such as burnt toast or steam from a bathroom.

Accordingly, to reduce the likelihood of nuisance alarms, it is preferable that smoke alarms are not located near cooking
appliances and bathrooms. However, if it is necessary to locate alarms in these positions, the type of alarm installed
may need to be considered as some alarm types may be more suitable in certain locations.


**Explanatory Information: Added flexibility when considering smoke alarm location**

The options described in the ABCB Housing Provisions are not the only means available for complying with this Part.
The performance-based nature of the NCC provides flexibility to develop alternative methods if it is preferred to meet
the Performance Requirement in some other way. This added flexibility may be utilised when considering the location
of smoke alarms.

(b) if natural light of a suitable standard is not available.


**Explanatory Information**

H4P4(1) nominates a minimum average daylight factor for rooms provided with natural light. Note that H4V2 provides
a method by which average daylight factor may be calculated.

To comply with H4P4(2), the level of artificial light must enable safe movement by occupants, appropriate to the use of
the building. For example, in a movie room a lower level of lighting may be appropriate while a movie is being screened,
however at the beginning and end of the movie when occupants are entering and exiting the movie room the minimum
lighting level of 20 lux may be appropriate.

than a kitchen) in an adjoining dwelling, must provide insulation against impact generated sound sufficient to prevent
illness or loss of amenity to the occupants.

(3) The required sound insulation of walls must not be compromised by the incorporation or penetration of a pipe or other
service element.

###### H4P7 Condensation and water vapour management

[2019: P2.4.7]

Risks associated with water vapour and _condensation must be managed to minimise their impact on the health of_
occupants.


**Applications**

H4P7 only applies to a Class 1 building.


###### Verification Methods


###### H4V1 Room or space height

[2019: V2.4.2]

(1) Compliance with H4P2 is verified where the height of a room or space provides an appropriate activity support level
that does not unduly interfere with its intended function.

(2) For a room or space in (1), the activity support level must consider the dimensions of—

(a) doors, ramps, barriers, stairs and windows; and

(b) fixed fittings and domestic services; and

(c) fixed and moveable equipment or furniture; and

(d) occupant circulation spaces.


**Explanatory Information**

The intent of H4P2 is the height of a room or space is sufficient for the intended use of the room or space. ‘Intended
use’ recognises that the height required in a room or space is directly related to the room or space’s intended function.

H4V1 is a means to verify that the height of a room or space is suitable for the intended use, and therefore meets the
requirement of H4P2.

In relation to the intended function of a room or space, the activities that are likely to be undertaken by occupants in the
room of space, as well the features of the activities, are relevant considerations when determining a suitable height.

For example, if the intended use of a room is a gymnasium, then gymnastic activities are likely to be undertaken in the


-----

In terms of the occupants, their features and needs are also relevant when determining a suitable height. For example,
occupant features and needs would differ between rooms or spaces intended as a child’s play area, and rooms or
spaces intended for adult’s indoor cricket.

The method requires consideration of ‘activity traits’, ‘occupant traits’ and ‘activity support level’. Refer to Schedule 1
for more information on these terms.

When determining the activity support level, the method requires consideration of the relevant dimensions of items
likely to be located in the room or space, as well as occupant circulation spaces.

Some of these considerations are—

###### • stairs and ramps, since the height of the room of the space will change relative to the occupant during incline and

decline; and

###### • fixed fittings such as lights that may protrude from the ceiling and wash-basins; and

 • domestic services such as air-conditioners, heaters, ceiling fans and heated water systems; and

 • fixed equipment such manufacturing or processing equipment, permanent signage or displays and lifts; and

 • moveable equipment such as whitegoods; and

 • fixed furniture such as built-in wardrobes and permanent seating; and

 • moveable furniture such as wardrobes, desks and beds; and

 • occupant circulation spaces so that occupants can move comfortably and safety around the room or space.

For example, the location and dimensions of a wash-basin is a relevant consideration in determining the activity support
_level of a bathroom. This is because an occupant will typically need to access the wash-basin whilst standing, which_
will influence the necessary height of the space.

Another example is the consideration of moveable equipment such as a refrigerator in a kitchen. If the intended use of
a space is a kitchen, then it would be unrealistic to determine a sufficient height for the room without considering the
height of a typical refrigerator that would be located in the room.

###### H4V2 Verification of suitable natural light



[2019: V2.4.4]

Compliance with H4P4(1) is verified for the provision of natural light in all habitable rooms when the average daylight

_T_

Average Daylight Factor � _[W]_

_factor for each window is determined in accordance with the following formula:_ _A_ �1 �R[2]�,

where—

(a) _W_ [ = the net area of the light transmitting area of the ][window][ (m][2][); and ]


(b) _A[ = the total area of the internal wall, floor and ceiling surfaces (m][2][); and ]_

(c) _T[ = the diffuse light transmittance of the ][window][; and ]_


(d) [ = visible sky angle in degrees, measured in a plane normal to and from the centre of the ][window][; and ]

(e) _R[ = the area-weighted average reflectance of area ]_ _A[. ]_


**Explanatory Information**

H4V2 is equivalent to F6V3 in NCC Volume One. Guidance on the use of F6V3 can be found in the Guide to NCC
Volume One, and is applicable to the use of H4V2.


###### H4V3 Verification of indoor air quality

[2019: V2.4.5]

For a Class 1 building, compliance with H4P5(1) and H4P5(2)(a) is verified when it is determined that the building under
typical conditions in use is provided with sufficient ventilation with outdoor air such that contaminant levels do not exceed
the limits specified in Table H4V3


-----

**Table H4V3:** **Maximum contaminant limits for acceptable indoor air quality**

|Pollutant|Averaging Time|Maximum Air Quality Value|
|---|---|---|
|Carbon dioxide, CO 2|8 hours|850 ppm Note 1|
|Carbon monoxide, CO|15 minutes|90 ppm|
|Carbon monoxide, CO|30 minutes|50 ppm|
|Carbon monoxide, CO|1 hour|25 ppm|

|Nitrogen dioxide, NO 2|1 hour|200 μg/m3 (0.0987 ppm) Note 2|
|Ozone, O 3|8 hour, daily maximum|100 μg/m3 (0.0473 ppm)|
|Particulate matter, PM 2.5|1 year|10 μg/m3|
|Particulate matter, PM 2.5|24 hour (99th percentile)|25 μg/m3|
|Particulate matter, PM 10|1 year|20 μg/m3|
|Particulate matter, PM 10|24 hour (99th percentile)|50 μg/m3|
|Total volatile organic compounds|1 hour|500 μg/m3|

_SA H5P3_


###### Verification Methods


###### H5V1 Wire barriers

[2019: V2.5.1]

Compliance with H5P2(2)(c) and (d) for wire barriers is verified when the wire barrier passes the test described below:

(a) The test must be carried out on either—

(i) a prototype of a wire barrier that is identical to that proposed to be installed on site; or

(ii) a wire barrier installed on site.

(b) The test equipment must consist of the following:

(i) A horizontally suspended 125 mm diameter, 405 mm long cylinder of 1 mm thick steel having a highly

polished 105 mm long cone at one end with a 20 mm diameter flat leading edge to which an eye bolt is
fixed.

(ii) A sufficiently flexible horizontal cable with mechanisms capable of applying and measuring a tension of 150

N (or a 15.3 kg weight suspended over a low friction pulley) is to be attached to the eye bolt (see Figure
H5V1).

(iii) A mechanism capable of measuring the tension force applied to each wire.

(c) The test procedure must be as follows:

(i) Tension the wires, within their safe load, to the same tension in all wires and measure the tensions with a

strain indicator.

(ii) For—

(A) horizontal or near horizontal wires, position the cone against a pair of wires at the mid-span between

supports, then apply the 150 N tension force to the cone; and

(B) vertical wires, position the cone against a pair of wires at the mid-span between supporting rails, then

apply the 150 N tension force to the cone; and

(C) near-vertical wires, position the cone against a pair of wires at the widest opening between the wires,

then apply the 150 N tension force to the cone.

(iii) Attempt to pull the cone through the gap between the wires under the 150 N load, and—

(A) increase the tension in the wires and repeat (ii) until such time as the cone will not pull through; or

(B) if it does not pull through, reduce the tension in the wires and repeat step (ii).

(iv) When the cone is just prevented from pulling through the gap, the wires are at the correct tension in which

case the cone is withdrawn and the tension recorded.


-----

after the cone has been removed and then calculate the average of the three tensions as the required
tension for each wire.

(vi) For prototype tests of horizontal or near horizontal wires, record the deflection of each wire at the average

tension calculated in accordance with (v) when a 2 kg mass is hung at mid-span between supports.


(d) The test report must include the following information:

(i) The name and address of the person supervising the test.


(ii) The test report number.

(iii) The date of the test.


(iv) The wire manufacturer’s name and address, and specifications of the wires used in the test including the

safe load limit of the wires.

components including supports, post or railing spacings and wire spacings.

(vi) For a prototype test, the required tension calculated in accordance with (c)(v).


(vii) For prototype tests of horizontal or near horizontal wires, the deflection measured in accordance with (c)(vi).


**Explanatory Information**

H5V1 is a means to verify that a proposed wire barrier satisfies the requirements of H5P2(2)(c) and (d).


The meaning of the phrase “prototype that is identical to that proposed to be installed” is similar to the testing of
prototypes for fire resistance. That is the prototype and the installation must be identical with respect to the type of wire,
the wire diameter, the number of lays, the wire tension, the post spacing and size, etc.

The test procedure is slightly different for barriers with horizontal or near horizontal wires and vertical wires or near
vertical wires (see the test procedures set out in H5V1(c)(ii)).

H5V1(c)(vi) allows measuring deflection of wires to verify that the required tension has been achieved.


It should be noted that H5V1 is only one form of compliance solution which can be used to demonstrate compliance
with H5P2(2)(c) and (d). The following means of verification are available:

###### • H5V1.



###### • The Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions in Part 11.3 of the ABCB Housing Provisions.

 • A Performance Solution that uses one of the other NCC Assessment Methods which verifies that H5P2(2)(c) and

(d) will be achieved.

(k) degree of occupant awareness of outside environmental conditions; and

(l) degree of essential maintenance.


**Applications**

H7P6 only applies to a Class 10c building.


**Notes**

NCC Volume Two and the ABCB Housing Provisions do not contain any Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for H7P6,
however the ABCB Performance Standard for Private Bushfire Shelters contains guidance for H7P6

###### Verification Methods


###### H7V1 Combustion appliances

Compliance with H7P3(a) and (b) is verified when—

(a) components used within an appliance and its installation are constructed from—



[2019: V2.7.1]


(i) heat-resistant materials for maximum operating temperatures more than 600℃, where the material complies

with (c); or

(ii) heat-tolerant materials for maximum operating temperatures more than 150℃ and less than 600℃, where

the material complies with (c); and

(b) the building elements surrounding the appliance maintain their designed function and material properties inclusive

of a full range of thermal movements when exposed to the heat effects of the appliance; and

(c) a sample of the material is tested to the maximum operating temperature, specified in (a)(i) or (a)(ii) for a

minimum of 96 hours; and

(d) the tested sample, when allowed to cool, must be free from—

(i) visible cracks and fractures; and

(ii) visible indication of de-lamination; and

(iii) linear distortion in excess of the equivalent of 10 mm per metre, and

(iv) deterioration of the appearance of any surface finish, when compared to an unheated sample.


**Explanatory Information**

Under H7V1, it needs to be demonstrated that the proposed appliance will not deteriorate under standard operating
conditions. Examples of deterioration may include deformation or failure of components that would render the appliance
unsafe to use.

For the purposes of demonstrating compliance with (a), the typical operating temperature of a combustion device can
be established by testing.

For the purposes of demonstrating compliance with (b), materials used for building elements (walls, floors and ceiling)
in the areas surrounding an appliance can be appropriately selected and/or designed to align with the quantified values
as determined by (a). This could either be achieved by using Expert Judgement or by adhering to manufacturer’s
specifications. Certification in accordance with CodeMark Australia would also be a possibility in demonstrating
compliance using the Verification Method.

Full range of thermal movements relates to both the appliance and materials when exposed to both the heated and
ambient conditions.

Benefits to industry derived from the application of this Verification Method includes the potential use of non-standard
national or internationally manufactured appliances. For example, test reports from appliances complying with various
ISO Standards and various British Standards could be used to demonstrate compliance with the Verification Method.
The Verification Method also allows for in situ testing of unique combustion appliances, which would not easily be tested
in accordance with the Australian Standard. Such testing would need to be verified by a suitably qualified practitioner
and be supported by appropriate documentation.


###### H7V2 Buildings in bushfire prone areas

[2019: V2.7.2]

(1) Compliance with H7P5 is verified if the ignition probability for a building exposed to a design bushfire does not exceed
10%.

(2) Bushfire design actions must be determined in consideration of the annual probability of a design bushfire derived
from—


-----

(a) assigning the building or structure an Importance Level in accordance with (3); and

(b) determining the corresponding annual probability of exceedance in accordance with Table H7V2.

(3) A building or structure’s Importance Level must be identified as one of the following:

(a) Importance Level 1 — where the building or structure presents a low degree of hazard to life and other property

in the case of failure.

(b) Importance Level 2 — where the building or structure is not of Importance Level 1 or 4 and is a Class 1a or 1b

building accommodating 12 people or less.

(c) Importance Level 4 — where the building is a Class 10c building and is subject to a necessary ‘defend in place’

strategy.

(4) The ignition probability for a building must be assessed by application of the following:

(a) An event tree analysis of relevant bushfire scenarios.

(b) Design bushfire conditions that include combinations of the following actions appropriate to the distance between

the building and the bushfire hazard:

(i) Direct attack from airborne burning embers.

(ii) Burning debris and accumulated embers adjacent to a building element.

(iii) Radiant heat from a bushfire front.

(iv) Direct flame attack from a bushfire front.

(5) Applied fire actions must allow for reasonable variations in—

(a) fire weather; and

(b) vegetation, including fuel load, burning behaviour of vegetation (including the potential for crown fires); and

(c) the distance of the building from vegetation; and

(d) topography, including slopes and features that may shield; and

(e) ignition of adjacent buildings, building elements, plants, mulch and other materials; and

(f) effective size of fire front; and

(g) duration of exposure; and

(h) flame height; and

(i) flame tilt; and

(j) flame adhesion to sloping land; and

(k) the height of the building and its elements.

(6) The assessment process must include consideration of—

(a) the probability of non-complying construction of critical aspects of an approved design; and

(b) the probability of critical aspects of an approved design being fully functional during the life of the building; and

(c) inclusion of safety factors; and

(d) sensitivity analysis of critical aspects of a proposed design.

**Notes**

There are no Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for H7P6.


_NSW H7D2_

###### H7D2 Swimming pools

_NT H7D2(1)_

_QLD H7D2(1)_



[2019: 3.10.1]


(1) _Performance Requirement_ H7P1 is satisfied for a swimming pool with a depth of water more than 300 mm and which
is associated with a Class 1 building, if it has safety barriers installed in accordance with AS 1926.1 and AS 1926.2.

_TAS H7D2(2)_

(2) _Performance Requirement_ H7P2 is satisfied for a water recirculation system of a swimming pool with a depth of water
more than 300 mm, if it complies with AS 1926.3.

_SA H7D2(3)_

_SA H7D2(4)_

_SA H7D2(5)_


**Explanatory Information: Definition of ‘swimming pool’**

The NCC definition of swimming pool is specific in including a bathing or wading pool and a spa. The requirements of
AS 1926.3 apply to all types of pools defined as swimming pools under the NCC, irrespective of the definition in the
Standard.


**Explanatory Information: Water recirculation systems**

The swimming pool water recirculation system requirements seek to minimise the risk of entrapment or injury of people
using the swimming pool and provide for the safe operation of skimmer boxes and outlet systems.


**Explanatory Information: Additional requirements**

Part 13.7 of the ABCB Housing Provisions contains requirements for swimming pool and spa pool heating and pumping.
In specific circumstances, Part 13.7 requires a swimming pool or spa pool to have a cover to reduce evaporation and
subsequent heat loss, and time switches to control the operation of the heater.


-----

In addition to the requirements of this Part, a swimming pool must comply with the structural requirements of other
Parts of NCC Volume Two and the ABCB Housing Provisions. The structural requirements refer to the swimming pool
being designed and constructed to withstand any combinations of loads and other actions to which it may reasonably
be subjected and the structural resistance of the materials and forms of construction used in the swimming pool.


**Explanatory Information: Cross-volume considerations**

Part C2 of NCC Volume Three sets out the requirements for pumped discharge from swimming pools.


###### H7D3 Construction in alpine areas

[2019: 3.10.4]

(1) Compliance with Part 12.2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions satisfies Performance Requirement H7P4 for buildings
that are located in alpine areas

(2) The Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of this Part apply in addition to other Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of NCC Volume
Two and the ABCB Housing Provisions.

(3) Where any Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions are in conflict, the provisions of H7D3 take precedence.

_NSW H7D4_

###### H7D4 Construction in bushfire prone areas

[2019: 3.10.5]

(1) The requirements of (2) only apply in a designated bushfire prone area.

(2) _Performance Requirement_ H7P5 is satisfied for a Class 1 building, or a Class 10a building or deck associated with a
Class 1 building, if it is constructed in accordance with—

(a) AS 3959; or

(b) NASH Standard – Steel Framed Construction in Bushfire Areas.

_QLD H7D4(3)_

_SA H7D4(3)_

###### H7D5 Heating appliances, fireplaces, chimneys and flues

[2019: 3.10.7]

_Performance Requirement_ H7P3 is satisfied for a heating appliance if it is installed in accordance with—

(a) for a domestic solid fuel burning appliance, AS/NZS 2918; or

(b) for a heating appliance, Part 12.4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions.


**Explanatory Information**

H7D5 applies to three types of heating appliances and includes the following:

###### • Open fireplaces — where solid fuel such as timber or coals are burnt in an unenclosed compartment. The

requirements in Part 12.4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions for open fireplaces relate to masonry or concrete
construction for all parts including the hearth, external faces and walls forming the back and sides and chimney.

###### • Insert fireplaces — manufactured and assembled in factories and inserted into the openings of masonry fireplaces

in a building. All insert fireplaces must be tested to AS/NZS 2918 and have closed fire compartments for the burning
of solid fuels.

###### • Free standing heating appliances — manufactured and assembled in factories and installed in the building without

being concealed by wall or floor elements. All free standing fireplaces must be tested to AS/NZS 2918 and are
_required to be positioned in a building that meets specific minimum distances from internal building elements._

The requirements of both H7D5(a) and Part 12.4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions are intended to ensure the


-----

ensure there is no spread of fire from within the heating appliance to adjacent building elements.


In addition to this, the requirements ensure hot products of combustion and smoke do not affect the occupants within
the building. This is achieved by requiring construction and installation of heating appliances to transfer products of
combustion and smoke directly to the outside atmosphere.

Insert fireplaces fuelled by gas are not covered by Part 12.4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions. Insert gas fireplaces may
be regulated by relevant authorities responsible for gas installations in each State or Territory jurisdiction and may be
required to comply with AS/NZS 5601 – Gas installations.

_NSW Part H8_

###### Introduction to this Part

This Part sets out requirements for dwellings to include features that are designed to improve their accessibility and usability
for occupants and visitors, including those with a mobility-related disability.


**Notes**

Part H8 Livable housing design does not take effect until 1 October 2023.


**Notes: Tasmania Part H8 Livable housing design**

For Tasmania, Part H8 does not take effect until 1 October 2024.


###### Objectives


###### H8O1 Objective



[New for 2022]

The Objective of this Part is to ensure that housing is designed to meet the needs of the community, including older
people and those with a mobility-related disability.


**Applications**

H8O1 only applies to a Class 1a building.


###### Functional Statements


###### H8F1 Livable housing design

A dwelling should be designed such that it is—

(a) easy to enter; and

(b) easy to navigate in and around; and

(c) capable of easy and cost effective adaptation; and

(d) responsive to the changing needs of occupants.



[New for 2022]


**Explanatory Information**

H8F1 only applies to a Class 1a building.


###### Performance Requirements


-----

###### H8P1 Livable housing design

A Class 1a building must be provided with—

(a) a continuous and step-free path to a dwelling entrance door from either—

(i) the pedestrian entry at the allotment boundary; or

(ii) an appurtenant Class 10a garage or carport; or

(iii) a car parking space provided for the exclusive use of the occupants of the dwelling; and



[New for 2022]


(b) at least one level and step-free entrance door into the dwelling from the access path required by (a); and

(c) internal doors and corridors on the ground or entrance level which facilitate unimpeded movement between

spaces; and

(d) a sanitary compartment that—

(i) facilitates independent access and use; and

(ii) is located on the ground or entry level; and

(e) a shower that facilitates independent access and use; and

(f) the walls of the sanitary compartment referred to in (d), the shower referred to in (e) and a bath (where installed,

other than a freestanding bath) constructed so as to facilitate future installation of grabrails, or the like, in a way
that minimises the removal of existing wall linings.


**Exemptions**

H8P1(a) need not be complied with if—

(a) step-free access cannot be provided from an appurtenant Class 10a garage or carport or a car parking space

provided for the exclusive use of the occupants of the dwelling; and

(b) due to site conditions, there is no other suitable location on which to construct the access path.


###### Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions


###### H8D1 Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions

[New for 2022]

(1) Where a Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution is proposed, Performance Requirement H8P1 is satisfied by complying with
H8D2.

(2) Where a _Performance Solution is proposed, the relevant_ _Performance Requirements must be determined in_
accordance with A2G2(3) and A2G4(3).

###### H8D2 Livable housing design

[New for 2022]

(1) A Class 1a dwelling must comply with the ABCB Standard for Livable Housing Design.

(2) Clause 1.1 of the ABCB Standard for Livable Housing Design need not be complied with if—

(a) step-free access via an appurtenant garage, carport or parking space in accordance with Clause 1.1(1)(b) or (c)

is not provided; and

(b) one or more of the following conditions exist:

(i) The average slope of the ground on which the access path would be constructed exceeds a gradient of

1:14.

(ii) To provide an external step-free access path would necessitate construction of ramping that exceeds the

length and gradient allowed by Clause 1 1(4)


-----

(iii) There is insufficient space available on the site on which to construct a step-free access path complying

with Clause 1.1.

(iv) Subject to (3), the difference in level, measured vertically from the pedestrian entry at the allotment boundary

or parking space to the floor level at the entrance door on the nearest floor containing habitable rooms,
would necessitate construction of ramping that exceeds the length and gradient allowed under Clause
1.1(4).

(3) For the purposes of (2)(b)(iv), the difference in level must be measured from the floor level at the entrance door, or if
there is an attached deck, balcony or the like that provides a step-free connection to the entrance door, from the
lowest point of that deck, balcony or the like above the surface beneath,

(4) Even if Clause 1.1 is not complied with, all other relevant provisions of the ABCB Standard for Livable Housing Design
must still be complied with.


**Explanatory Information: Exemptions**

The exemptions listed at H8D2(2)(b)(i) and (ii) provide for situations where the ramping necessary to provide a stepfree access path would become too lengthy or too steep to be used regularly by a person with limited mobility, and
therefore would offer little benefit to dwelling occupants or visitors. Such situations may occur due to a number of factors
including (but not limited to) the following:

###### • The slope of the land upon which the ramp would be constructed. For example, if the required step-free access

path cannot be provided in one continuous direction, meaning it would instead need to be cut into the slope, or
would run back and forth across the face of the slope, in order to stay within maximum gradient limits.

###### • The height of the lowest floor containing habitable rooms is too high to be reached by a ramp within required length

and gradient limits. Floor heights can be influenced by factors such as dwelling style, defined flood level, location
of the dwelling in an alpine area, or construction of the dwelling directly above a private garage (including garagetop dwellings).

The exemption listed at H8D2(2)(b)(iii) provides for situations where the amount of available space on the site is
insufficient to accommodate a step-free access path. This may be due to the physical size of the site, or regulations
outside of the NCC which limit the proportion of a site that can be covered by structures and/or impervious ground
coverings.

It is important to note that under H8D2(2), an exemption may only be applied if, in a particular case, both (a) and (b)
are applicable, not just one or the other.

###### S42C1 Scope

[New for 2022]

This Specification sets out requirements for satisfying H6P1 and H6P2 using house energy rating software.

###### S42C2 Heating and cooling loads

[2019: 3.12.0.1]

(1) A building must achieve an energy rating, including the separate heating and cooling load limits, using house energy
_rating software, of greater than or equal to—_

(a) 7 stars; or

(b) for a building in climate zones 1 or 2, 6.5 stars if the building has an outdoor living area as described in (3) which

is fully covered with an impervious roof having a Total R-Value greater than or equal to 1.5 (for downward heat
flow); or

(c) for a building in climate zones 1 or 2, 6 stars if the building has an outdoor living area as described in (3) which—

(i) is fully covered with an impervious roof having a Total R-Value greater than or equal to 1.5 (for downward

heat flow); and

(ii) has at least one permanently installed ceiling fan.

(2) The heating and cooling load limits in (1) are specified in the ABCB Standard for NatHERS Heating and Cooling Load
Limits.

(3) An outdoor living area in (1)(b) and (1)(c) is a space that—

(a) is directly adjoining, and directly accessible from, a general purpose living area of a Class 1 building such as a

lounge, kitchen, dining or family room, which is not a room for sleeping or specialist tasks such as a study or
home theatre; and

(b) has a floor area greater than or equal to 12.0 m[2]; and

(c) has length and width dimensions greater than or equal to 2.5 m each; and

(d) has an opening height above floor level greater than or equal to 2.1 m; and

(e) has one side permanently open with a second side either—

(i) permanently open; or

(ii) readily openable.

(4) The sides referred to in (3)(e) must be greater than or equal to 900 mm from an allotment boundary or 900 mm from
an obstruction to the breeze path such as a building, fence or other structure.

(5) Where a ceiling fan is required as part of compliance with (1)(c), the fan must—

(a) be permanently installed; and

(b) have a speed controller; and

(c) serve the whole room, with the floor area that a single fan serves not exceeding—

(i) 15 m[2] if it has a blade rotation diameter of less than 1200 mm; and

(ii) 25 m[2] if it has a blade rotation diameter of greater than or equal to 1200 mm.


**Explanatory Information: Complying with S42C2(1)**

###### • To comply with (1), the modelled energy loads of a building must not exceed three separate load limits, i.e.—

(i) the total load limit corresponding to the applicable star rating; and


-----

(iii) the cooling load limit.



###### • Information about building modelling using house energy rating software is available at www.nathers.gov.au.

 • The ABCB Standard for NatHERS Heating and Cooling Load Limits can be accessed at www.abcb.gov.au.


**Explanatory Information: Outdoor living areas**

###### • The opening height in (3)(d) is to provide a breeze path and is likely to be the measurement from the floor to the

underside of a perimeter beam. It is not a ceiling height measurement. It is also not a height for mounting a ceiling
fan or the height of ceiling fan blades above the floor. These dimensions need to be determined considering the
activities in the space, the safety of occupants of the space and any appropriate safety standards.

###### • There is some survey evidence that suggests the majority of home owners turn off their air-conditioners when using

an outdoor living area. Another cost effective option is to install a reed switch or other micro switch on the door
leading to the outdoor living area in order to automatically deactivate an air-conditioning unit when the door is left
open for a period which allows occupants to enter and leave the air-conditioned space but does not affect the
operation of the air-conditioner.

###### • A side referred to in (3)(e) may contain some obstructions such as columns and barriers. Where an open side is

_required to have a 1 m barrier, consideration as to the type (wire, solid or other) should be made with regard to the_
overall opening area of the two sides.


###### S42C3 Net equivalent energy usage

[New for 2022]

A building must achieve a whole-of-home rating of not less than 60 using house energy rating software.

###### S42C4 Additional Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions when using house energy rating software

[3.12.0]

(1) To comply with H6P1, in addition to S42C2, a building must comply with Section 13 of the ABCB Housing Provisions
clauses—

(a) 13.2.2, for building fabric thermal insulation; and

(b) 13.2.3(7) and 13.2.5(5), for thermal breaks; and

(c) 13.2.3(5), for compensating for a loss of ceiling insulation, other than where the house energy rating software

has compensated for a loss of ceiling insulation; and

(d) 13.2.6(4), 13.2.6(5) and 13.2.6(6) for floor edge insulation; and

(e) Part 13.4, for building sealing.

(2) To comply with H6P2, in addition to S42C3, a building must comply with Part 13.7 of the ABCB Housing Provisions.

J3D14(1)(a) of NCC Volume One or 13.6.2(1)(a) of the ABCB Housing Provisions.


**Notes**

(1) If a multi-split air-conditioning unit is installed, it is considered to be a single heating or cooling service.

(2) A series of separate heaters or coolers of the one type can be considered a single heater or cooler type with a

performance level of that of the unit with the lowest efficiency.


-----

**Explanatory Information**

The purpose of defining for main space conditioning is to provide criteria upon which the heating or cooling equipment
should be selected when showing compliance with J3D14(1)(a) of NCC Volume One and 13.6.2(1)(a) of the ABCB
Housing Provisions when more than one type and efficiency of equipment is present. In J3D14(1)(a) the formula that
determines ER allows the selection of only one heating or cooling system. This definition requires that if any one system
serves at least 70% of the floor area that is heated or cooled it should be used as the basis of determining ER. If,
however, no one system serves at least 70% of the floor area, then the appliance that results in the highest net equivalent
energy usage, when calculated in accordance with J3D14(1)(a)/13.6.2(1)(a), should be selected.

provisions applicable in New South Wales.

The technical package is accompanied by administrative provisions contained within the Environmental Planning and
Assessment (EP&A) Act 1979, the Environmental Planning and Assessment (EP&A) Regulation 2021 and the
Environmental Planning and Assessment (EP&A) (Development Certification and Fire Safety) Regulation 2021

Note:

Where NSW has inserted or replaced a whole clause or part, the clause or part reference will be preceded by the prefix
NSW. i.e. NSW H1D4(1). All table and image references which are replaced or inserted will also have a similar prefix.
Where NSW has not replaced a complete clause but modified, inserted or replaced part of a clause, the prefix has been
omitted and the parent clause reference remains unchanged.


-----

###### Part A6 Building classification

_Delete A6G7 and insert NSW A6G7 as follows:_

###### NSW A6G7 Class 6 buildings

[2019: NSW A6.6]

A Class 6 building is a shop or other building for sale of goods by retail or the supply of services direct to the public,
including—

(a) an eating room, cafe, restaurant, milk or soft drink bar; or

(b) a dining room, bar, shop or kiosk part of a hotel or motel; or

(c) a hairdresser’s or barber’s shop, public laundry, or undertaker’s establishment; or

(d) market or sale room, showroom, or service station; or

(e) _small live music or arts venue._


-----

###### Part H1 Structure

 H1D4 Footings and slabs

_Delete H1D4(1) and insert NSW H1D4(1) as follows:_



[2019: 3.2.0, 3.2.1]


(1) _Performance Requirement_ H1P1 is satisfied for footings and slabs if they are installed in accordance with either (a)
or (b):

(a) One of the following:

(i) AS 2870 except that for the purposes of Clause 5.3.3.1 of AS 2870 a damp-proofing membrane is required

to be provided.

(ii) AS 3600 except that barriers installed beneath slab on ground construction must have a high resistance to

damage during construction.

(b) Subject to (2), Section 4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions.

###### Part H2 Damp and weatherproofing

_Delete H2P3 and insert NSW H2P3 as follows:_

###### NSW H2P3 Rising damp

[2019: NSW P2.2.3]

(1) Moisture from the ground must be prevented from causing—

(a) unhealthy or dangerous conditions, or loss of amenity for occupants; and

(b) undue dampness or deterioration of building elements.

(2) Barriers installed beneath slab on ground construction for the purposes of (1) must have a high resistance to damage
during construction.


**Limitations**

NSW H2P3 does not apply to a Class 10 building where in the particular case there is no necessity for compliance.


**Explanatory Information**

The intent of requiring the barrier to have a high resistance to damage during construction is to increase the barrier’s
ability to resist punctures during construction. By being less susceptible to puncturing, the barrier will provide increased
protection against moisture containing dissolved salts from coming into contact with the concrete slab.


###### Part H3 Fire safety

_Delete H3D5 and insert NSW H3D5 as follows:_

###### NSW H3D5 Fire separation of garage top dwellings

[2019: NSW 3.7.4]

Compliance with NSW Part 9.4 of the ABCB Housing Provisions satisfies _Performance Requirement_ H3P1 for fire
separation of garage top dwellings.


-----

###### Part H7 Ancillary provisions and additional construction requirements

_Delete H7P1 and insert NSW H7P1 as follows:_

###### NSW H7P1 Swimming pool access

[2019: NSW P2.7.1]

A barrier must be provided to a swimming pool and must—

(a) be continuous for the full extent of the hazard; and

(b) be of a strength and rigidity to withstand the foreseeable impact of people; and

(c) restrict the access of young children to the pool and the immediate pool surrounds; and

(d) have any gates and doors fitted with latching devices not readily operated by young children, and constructed

to automatically close and latch.


**Applications**

H7P1 only applies to a swimming pool with a depth of water more than 300 mm, in conjunction with the Swimming
Pools Act 1992 and the Swimming Pools Regulation 2018.


_Delete H7D2 and insert NSW H7D2 as follows:_

###### NSW H7D2 Swimming pools

[2019: NSW 3.10.1.0]

(1) _Performance Requirement_ H7P1 is satisfied for a swimming pool with a depth of water more than 300 mm and which
is associated with a Class 1 building, if it has safety barriers installed in accordance with—

(a) AS 1926.1 and AS 1926.2; or

(b) if the swimming pool is a spa pool—

(i) the requirements of (1)(a); or

(ii) clause 9 of the Swimming Pools Regulation 2018.

(2) _Performance Requirement_ H7P2 is satisfied for a water recirculation system of a swimming pool with a depth of water
more than 300 mm, if it complies with AS 1926.3.


**Applications**

NSW H7D2(1) applies in New South Wales to the technical construction requirements for barriers to restrict access to
_swimming pools, subject to—_

(a) out-of-ground pool walls and the walls of above ground pools, including inflatable pools, not being considered to

be effective barriers; and

(b) the reference in clause 2.3.1 of AS 1926.1 to a barrier within a property including a boundary barrier.


**Notes**

The Swimming Pools Act 1992 and the Swimming Pool Regulation 2018, applicable to swimming pools with a depth of
water of more than 300 mm, regulate the circumstances in which a barrier is required and prevail in the case of any
inconsistency.


**Explanatory Information**

**Definition of ‘swimming pool’**

The NCC definition of swimming pools is specific in including a bathing or wading pool and a spa. The requirements of
AS 1926.3 apply to all types of pools defined as swimming pools under the NCC, irrespective of the definition in the
Standard.


-----

**Explanatory Information**

**Water recirculation systems**

The swimming pool water recirculation system requirements seek to minimise the risk of entrapment or injury of people
using the swimming pool and provide for the safe operation of skimmer boxes and outlet systems.


**Explanatory Information**

**Additional requirements**

In addition to the requirements of this Part, a swimming pool must comply with the structural requirements of other
Parts of NCC Volume Two and the ABCB Housing Provisions. The structural requirements refer to the swimming pool
being designed and constructed to withstand any combinations of loads and other actions to which it may reasonably
be subjected and the structural resistance of the materials and forms of construction used in the swimming pool.


**Explanatory Information**

**Cross-volume considerations**

Part C2 of NCC Volume Three sets out the requirements for pumped discharge from swimming pools.


_Delete H7D4 and insert NSW H7D4 as follows:_

###### NSW H7D4 Construction in bushfire prone areas

section 4.14 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 if required; or

(d) (a) or (b) as modified by development consent with a bushfire safety authority issued under section 100B of the

Rural Fires Act 1997 for the purposes of integrated development.


**Explanatory Information**

In New South Wales, buildings subject to BAL-FZ must comply with specific conditions of development consent for
construction at this level.


###### NSW Part H8 Livable housing design

This Part has deliberately been left blank. Part H8 does not apply in NSW, as livable housing design requirements do not
apply to Class 1a buildings in NSW.


-----

###### Introduction to this Part

This NSW Part H6 replaces Part H6.

This Part is intended to improve the efficient use of energy in building design and construction, as well as the energy
usage by key equipment installed in a building.


**Notes**

From 1 May 2023 to 30 September 2023 NSW Parts 2.6 and 3.12 may apply instead of NSW Part H6 of NCC 2022
Volume Two. From 1 October 2023 NSW Part H6 of NCC 2022 Volume Two applies.


**Notes**

(1) Where a relevant _development consent or an application for a complying development certificate requires_

compliance with a BASIX Single Dwelling or Multi Dwelling Certificate issued under Version 3.0 or earlier, NSW
Addition NSW 2 Energy efficiency of NCC 2019 Volume Two Amendment 1 applies.

(2) Where a relevant _development consent or an application for a complying development certificate requires_

compliance with a BASIX Single Dwelling or Multi Dwelling Certificate issued under Version 4.0 or later, NSW Part
H6 of NCC 2022 Volume Two applies.

(3) Where a relevant _development consent or an application for a complying development certificate requires_

compliance with a BASIX Alterations and Additions Certificate, NSW Additions NSW 2 Energy efficiency of NCC
2019 Volume Two Amendment 1 applies.


**Notes**

In NSW, Class 1 buildings and certain Class 10 buildings are subject to BASIX (the Building Sustainability Index).

BASIX is the web-based planning tool designed to assess the potential performance of certain residential buildings
against a range of sustainability indices including thermal comfort and energy. Commitments made under BASIX become
a condition of the relevant development consent or complying development certificate.

BASIX applies in NSW to all new Class 1 buildings, certain Class 10 buildings; and to alterations and additions to
buildings of those classes where the work is subject to BASIX and also where an applicant elects to comply with BASIX.

The provisions of NSW Part H6 are therefore designed to complement requirements that arise under BASIX and which
are implemented via the development consent.

Where BASIX is not applied to alterations and additions to these buildings, the provisions will also complement council
development controls that require energy efficiency measures to be incorporated as part of the alterations and additions.


###### Performance Requirements


###### NSW H6P1 Building fabric

[2019: NSW P2.6.1(a)]

(1) Thermal insulation in a building must be installed in a manner and have characteristics, which facilitate the efficient
use of energy for artificial heating and cooling.

(2) A building must have, to the degree necessary, thermal breaks installed between the framing and external cladding,
to facilitate efficient thermal performance of the building envelope.


**Notes**

(a) NSW H6P1 only applies to thermal insulation in a Class 1 or 10 building where a development consent specifies

that the insulation is to be provided as part of the development


-----

(b) NSW H6P1(2) only applies to a metal framed roof and metal framed wall.


**Explanatory Information**

(a) In NSW, provision of thermal insulation of the building fabric may be nominated as a commitment on a BASIX

(Building Sustainability Index) Certificate and form part of the conditions of development consent relating to the
development.

(b) BASIX is applicable to alterations and additions the cost of which exceeds specified minimum values, or where an

applicant elects to comply with BASIX. Where BASIX is not applicable, a council’s development controls may also
specify the provision of thermal insulation in such alterations and additions.

(c) Thermal breaks between metal framing and cladding material of minimum thickness will reduce energy loss and

contribute to the efficient thermal performance of the building.


###### NSW H6P2 Building sealing

[2019: NSW P2.6.1(b)]

A building must have, to the degree necessary, a level of building sealing against air leakage to facilitate the efficient use
of energy for artificial heating and cooling appropriate to—

(a) the function and use of the building; and

(b) the internal environment; and

(c) the geographic location of the building.


**Limitations**

NSW H6P2 does not apply to—

(a) existing buildings being relocated; or

(b) Class 10a buildings—

(i) without a conditioned space; or

(ii) for the accommodation of vehicles; or

(c) parts of buildings that cannot be fully enclosed; or

(d) a permanent building opening, in a space where a gas appliance is located, that is necessary for the safe operation

of a gas appliance; or

(e) a building in climate zones 2 and 5 where the only means of air-conditioning is by using an evaporative cooler.


**Explanatory Information**

###### • The term “cannot be fully enclosed” means parts of buildings with permanent openings such as balconies, shade

rooms, rooms with fixed louvres, mesh or other material that allows air flow. Adjustable louvres are considered to
provide full enclosure to the opening they accommodate. Such rooms are unlikely to be conditioned given the high
air flow rates; therefore application of the Performance Requirement to these parts of buildings would not result in
reduction in energy use.

###### • Appropriate ventilation for gas appliances can be obtained from relevant legislation, referenced standards and

product installation manuals.


###### NSW H6P3 Services

[2019: NSW P2.6.2]

_Domestic services, including any associated distribution system and components must, to the degree necessary, have_
features that facilitate the efficient use of energy appropriate to—

(a) the domestic service and its usage; and

(b) the geographic location of the building; and


-----

(d) the energy source.


**Limitations**

NSW H6P3 does not apply to existing services associated with existing buildings being relocated.


###### Verification Methods


###### NSW H6V1 Application of NSW H6V3

The Verification Method in this Part only apply to—

(a) a Class 1 building; and

H6V2 does not apply in NSW.

###### NSW H6V3 Verification of building envelope sealing



[2019: V2.6.2.2]

[2019: NSW V2.6.1]


(1) Compliance with NSW H6P2 is verified for building envelope sealing when a building envelope is sealed at an air
permeability of not more than 10 m[3]/hr.m[2] at 50 Pa reference pressure when tested in accordance with AS/NZS ISO
9972 Method 1.

(2) Where an air permeability of not more than 5 m[3]/hr.m[2] at 50 Pa reference pressure is achieved—

(a) a mechanical ventilation system must be provided that—

(i) can be manually overridden; and

(ii) provides outdoor air, either—

(A) continuously; or

(B) intermittently, where the system has controls that enable operation for not less than 25 percent of each

4 hour segment; and

(iii) provides a flow rate not less than that achieved with the following formula: Q � �0 �05 �A �3 �5 � �N �1 ���p,

where—


(A) _Q[= the required air flow rate (L/s); and]_

(B) _A[= the total floor area of the building (m²); and]_


(C) _N_ [= the number of bedrooms in the building; and]


(D) _p_ [= the fraction of time within each 4 hour segment that the system is operational; and]

(b) any space with a solid-fuel burning combustion appliance must be ventilated with permanent openings directly

to outside with a free area of not less than half of the cross-sectional area of the appliance’s flue; and

This clause has deliberately been left blank.

Building work in designated flood hazard areas is regulated by the Building Act 1975 and Development Code 3.5 Construction of buildings in flood hazard areas.


_Insert QLD H1P3 as follows:_

###### QLD H1P3 Termite management measures

[2019: QLD P2.1.3]

(1) The risk of primary building element in a Class 1 or 10 building being damaged by subterranean termites must be
adequately minimised by the use of a suitable termite management measure that—

(a) if it serves a non-temporary Class 1 building, has a design life of at least 50 years; or

(b) if it serves a building not specified in (a), has a design life of at least 50 years or the specified design life of the

building, whichever is the lesser; or

(c) is easily and readily accessible for replenishment or replacement and is capable of being replenished or replaced.

(2) A termite management measure required by (1), to the degree necessary, must—

(a) be accessible to enable the installation, maintenance and inspection of the termite management measure to be

carried out; and

(b) incorporate suitable measures to adequately minimise the risk of the termite management measure inadvertently

being damaged, bridged or breached.


**Explanatory Information**

QLD H1P3(1) requires a termite management measure in Queensland to have a design life of at least 50 years unless
it is easily and readily accessible for replenishment or replacement and is capable of being replenished or replaced. In
recognition that some buildings other than non-temporary Class 1 buildings may be designed to last less than 50 years,
the option of the termite management measure having a design life at least equal to that specified for the building is
given. If this option is used, the design life of the building should be agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders at the
design stage and should form part of the documentation kept by the appropriate authority. It should not be assumed
that the design life of 50 years in QLD H1P3(1)(a) and (b) applies to any other provisions of the BCA, unless stated.

An example of a termite management measure that may satisfy QLD H1P3(1)(c) is a chemical reticulation system
beneath a concrete floor slab laid directly on the ground, provided that the system is easily and readily accessible for
replenishment and is capable of being replenished.

An example of a termite management measure that may not satisfy QLD H1P3(1) for a non-temporary Class 1 building
is a hand-sprayed chemical beneath a concrete floor slab laid directly on the ground if the chemical does not have a
design life of at least 50 years. The concrete floor slab being laid directly on the ground would prevent the area beneath
the slab from being easily and readily accessible for replenishment or replacement of the termite management measure.

An example of a termite management measure being inadvertently bridged or breached is when a person places a
garden or mulch over the top of or above the level of a termite management measure enabling termites to bypass the
measure.

The requirements of H1D7(2)(a)(ii) must be read in conjunction with the provisions of AS/NZS 1170.2. The ABCB
commissioned research to establish a nationally consistent testing regime for metal roof cladding assemblies in cyclonic
areas. The results of this research are contained in H1D7(2)(a)(ii).

Low cycle fatigue cracking of metal roof cladding elements during tropical cyclones is a complex process where small
changes in load, geometry or material properties can significantly affect the fatigue performance of the cladding system
(includes immediate supports, fixings and cladding). The consequences of failure of an element can quickly lead to
more elements progressively failing. These failed elements become wind driven debris and so pose a threat to people
and other structures as potential missiles.

If a system does not successfully resist the fatigue loading sequence in Table H1D7, it does not comply. The test section
consists of cladding elements, fastenings and immediate supporting members assembled together in a manner identical
to those parts of the particular roof which the test section is intended to replicate.


**Explanatory Information**

In Western Australia state variations apply to wind Regions B and D, this includes wind region B2 as referenced in
AS/NZS 1170.2.

The state variation for wind region B or B2 will ensure that designers consider the combination of peak external
pressures and increased internal pressures in design of buildings and use a cyclonic (C) classification instead of noncyclonic (N) classification The definition of design wind speed is varied in WA Schedule 1 to identify that wind Region


-----

B is a C classification in Western Australia. Other changes have also been made to reflect this.


In addition to a variation to clause H1D7 of NCC Volume Two, and clauses 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the ABCB Housing
Provisions Standard - a variation is made to the application of AS/NZS 1170.2 and AS 4055 (when used as a primary
referenced document, secondary or subsequent referenced document). Refer to the WA Schedule 2 and WA Part 2.3.

The state variation for wind region D applies only to those parts of region D located north of the Tropic of Capricorn.
The 2021 edition of AS/NZS 1170.2 includes a reduction in design wind speeds for wind region D. The variation will
retain similar design wind speeds for wind region D as the 2011 edition of AS/NZS 1170.2 previously referenced in the
National Construction Code.
