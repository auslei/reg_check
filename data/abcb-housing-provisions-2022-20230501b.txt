This Section is for information only.  
1.1 Introduction 
The ABCB Housing Provisions contains Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  that are considered to be acceptable forms of  
construction that meet the requirements for complying with Parts H1 to H8 of NCC Volume Two (i.e. they comply with the  
Performance Requirements  listed in Parts H1 to H8 of NCC Volume Two).  
There is no obligation to adopt any particular option contained in the ABCB Housing Provisions if it is preferred to meet  
the Performance Requirements  some other way.  
However, if one of the options described in the ABCB Housing Provisions or elsewhere in the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  
of NCC Volume Two is not complied with, then the appropriate authority  must be satisfied that the Performance  
Requirements  have been met.  
1.2 Application  
This Housing Provisions must be applied in accordance with each of the following:  
Section A (Governing Requirements) of NCC Volume Two.  •
Any conditions on the use of the ABCB Housing Provisions set out within the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  of NCC  •
Volume Two where it is referenced.  
The Scope clause at the beginning of each Section of the ABCB Housing Provisions.  •
1.3 The scope of the ABCB Housing Provisions  
In Section H of NCC Volume Two, some Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  contain more than one compliance pathway. Usually,  
the first of these pathways will be by reference to a relevant Australian Standard (or similar) and the second will be by  
reference to a particular Section or Part of the ABCB Housing Provisions. In these cases, use of the ABCB Housing  
Provisions is one option for complying with the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision . 
Other Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  contain only one compliance pathway: either a reference to an Australian Standard  
(or similar), or a reference to a particular Section or Part of the ABCB Housing Provisions. In these cases, the ABCB  
Housing Provisions may only be used if it is referenced, and must be used if it is the only compliance option for the particula r 
Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision . 
If a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision  does not reference the ABCB Housing Provisions, then the ABCB Housing Provisions  
cannot be used as a compliance pathway for that particular Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision . 
The ABCB Housing Provisions only contains content relevant to the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  in NCC Volume Two  
which call it up. Therefore, the ABCB Housing Provisions should not be interpreted as a comprehensive or complete  
manual for house building.  
Section 2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions contains a number of structural design manuals which can be used to design  
building elements using engineering principles. There is no obligation for the provisions of Section 2 to be used apart from  
situations where a particular building, building element or component is required to comply with NCC Volume Two and is  
not within the scope of any other Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions . 
Section 12 contains additional construction requirements that are ancillary to the construction of a building or structure,  
such as the construction of swimming pools , heating appliances, fireplaces, methods of attaching decks and balconies to  
external walls  or the like. Section 12 also contains special provisions for construction in alpine areas . Earthquake areas  
are addressed in Section 2 and flood hazard areas  are addressed in the ABCB Standard for Construction of Buildings in  
Flood Hazard Areas, which is referenced directly by H1D10.  
Situations where it is necessary for a mixed application of the ABCB Housing Provisions and other documents referenced  
in the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  of NCC Volume Two may be identified by reference to the differing components of  
the Performance Requirements  (see A2G3).  How to use the Housing Provisions
 (1 May 2023)
Front matter
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 81.4 Suitability of Performance Solutions  
The options described in the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  are typical examples of national construction methods. They  
are not the only means available for complying with NCC Volume Two. The performance format of the NCC provides  
flexibility and allows the use of alternative construction methods to those described in the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions . 
1.5 The use of maps 
Maps have been used throughout NCC Volume Two, including in the ABCB Housing Provisions, to indicate areas where  
particular requirements apply. These maps are indicative and some variation in conditions will apply, especially on the  
border of marked areas.  
It is recommended that the appropriate authority  be consulted and in most cases they should be able to identify what  
conditions apply in such areas at the early stage of building design.  
1.6 Consultation with appropriate authorities  
When building in certain locations there may be local conditions or other site constraints that may limit the type of  
construction that can be used. This is particularly important with buildings that are constructed in areas subject to increased  
structural loading conditions that may occur due to geographical, topographical or climatic conditions and soil types.  
Appropriate authorities  have a wide range of experience and information on the geographical and topographical conditions  
found in their area of responsibility, and should be consulted during the initial design stage.  
1.7 Layout of the ABCB Housing Provisions 
Although they do not cover every aspect of housing construction, the ABCB Housing Provisions have nonetheless been  
organised in a manner that follows the logical construction sequence of a building. Table 1.7  outlines some of the more  
frequently used details and where they are located in the ABCB Housing Provisions or NCC Volume Two.

1.8 Interpretation  
Throughout the ABCB Housing Provisions, diagrams, explanatory information and cross-volume considerations are  
included. A1G4 (interpretation) contains information on these elements in the NCC, which is also applicable when they  
appear in the ABCB Housing Provisions.  
1.9 How to use the requirements of each Section/Part  
Each Section of the ABCB Housing Provisions is comprised of a scope statement and one or more Parts which contain  
the technical provisions which must be followed as appropriate to achieve compliance with the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy  
Provisions . Generally, a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision  will refer to a specific Part of the ABCB Housing Provisions in order  
to link the user directly to the relevant technical provisions.  
Each Section contains a scope and application Part which sets out the conditions and limitation applicable to the  
subsequent Parts contained within that Section. Each Part must only be applied in a way that is consistent with its scope.  
Sections are numbered with a single numeral (e.g. Section 2 - Structure).  
Parts are numbered with two numbers separated by a decimal (e.g. Part 2.2 – Structural provisions).  
Clauses within each Part are numbered with three numbers separated by a decimal point (e.g. Clause 2.2.4 –  
Determination of structural resistance of materials and forms of construction).  
Sub-clauses and below are numbered using the system used throughout the NCC.Stage Relevant part Reference(s)

 2.1.1   Scope 
[New for 2022]  
(1) This Section sets out the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  for structural stability and resistance (see Part 2.2 ). 
(2) For other structural provisions not included in this Section, refer to the following Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  in NCC  
Volume Two: 
Site preparation — see H1D3.  (a)
Footings and slabs — see H1D4.  (b)
Masonry — see H1D5.  (c)
Framing — see H1D6.  (d)
Roof and wall cladding — see H1D7.  (e)
Glazing — see H1D8.  (f)

Attachment of decks and balconies to external walls  of buildings — see H1D11.  (i)
 2.1.2   Application  
[New for 2022]  
The application of Section 2 is subject to the following:  
The Governing Requirements of NCC Volume Two.  (a)
The State and Territory variations, additions and deletions contained in the Schedules to the ABCB Housing  (b)
Provisions and NCC Volume Two.  
 
Explanatory Information  
In NCC 2019, the content of Section 2 of the ABCB Housing Provisions (other than content added in NCC 2022 or later)  
was contained in Part 3.0 of NCC Volume Two.  Part 2.1 Scope and application of Section 2
 (1 May 2023)
Structure
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 22  
 
 2.2.1   Application of Part 2.2 
[New for 2022]  
Part 2.2  need not be complied with if, for the purposes of H1D2(b) only, the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  of H1D3 to  
H1D11 relating to structural elements are complied with.  
 2.2.2   Resistance to actions  
[2019: 3.0.2]  
The resistance of a building or structure must be greater than the most critical action effect resulting from different  
combinations of actions, where—  
the most critical action effect on a building or structure must be determined in accordance with 2.2.3  and the  (a)
general design procedures contained in AS/NZS 1170.0; and  
the resistance of a building or structure is determined in accordance with 2.2.4 . (b)
 
Explanatory Information  
A building or structure must be designed to resist the most critical effect resulting from different combinations of actions,  
taking into consideration—  
the probability of simultaneous occurrence of two or more actions; and  •
the levels of reliability of the structure when subject to combined actions; and  •
the characteristics of the action. •
Determining the levels of reliability of the structure when subject to combined actions should be consistent with the  
levels of reliability implicit in the design events for natural phenomenon. When designing for the maximum combined  
actions, a principle frequently adopted is that the maximum is likely to occur when at least one of the actions is at its  
maximum value.  
 
 
WA 2.2.3  
 2.2.3   Determination of individual actions  
[2019: 3.0.3]  
The magnitude of individual actions must be determined in accordance with the following:  
Permanent actions:  (a)
the design or known dimensions of the building or structure; and  (i)
the unit weight of the construction; and  (ii)
AS/NZS 1170.1. (iii)
Imposed actions:  (b)
the known loads that will be imposed during the occupation or use of the building or structure; and  (i)
construction activity actions ; and  (ii)
AS/NZS 1170.1. (iii)
Wind, snow and earthquake actions:  (c)
the applicable annual probability of design event for safety, determined by—  (i)
assigning the building or structure an Importance Level in accordance with Table 2.2.3a ; and  (A)
determining the corresponding annual probability of exceedance for safety in accordance with Table  (B)Part 2.2  Structural provisions

Explanatory Information : Permanent and imposed actions  
Permanent actions include the dead loads of the building or structure. These include the load imposed by the building’s  
components inclusive of the forces imposed by the floors, walls, roofs, suspended ceilings, etc.  
Imposed actions include live loads on the building or structure. These include the load arising from construction activity  
and the intended use or function of the building or structure.  
 
Explanatory Information : Application of AS 1170.4  
There are certain limitations on the application to domestic structures such as Class 1a and Class 1b buildings in 
Appendix A of AS 1170.4. These limitations include building height, roof slope, etc. For additional information refer to  
Appendix A of AS 1170.4.  
 
Explanatory Information : Importance Levels (Table 2.2.3a)  
Table 2.2.3a  provides a generic description of building types to which Importance Levels have been assigned. The  
“Importance Level” concept is applicable to building structural safety only. More specific examples are provided in the  
following list. The examples are indicative and not exhaustive.  
Importance Level 1: Isolated minor Class 10a buildings and Class 10b structures.  •
Importance Level 2: Class 1 buildings; Class 10a buildings and Class 10b structures associated with Class 1  •
buildings.  
Importance Levels must be assigned on a case by case basis and relate to the hazards to human life and other property  
in the event of the structure’s failure. For example—  
Importance Level 1 is for minor isolated structures that rarely contain people, are not required as part of normal  (a)
infrastructure and present a low risk to life and other property . 
Importance Level 2 includes domestic housing and structures intended to contain reasonable numbers of people  (b)
under normal operations.

Structure
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 25Explanatory Information : Construction in cyclonic areas  
The intent of building construction in cyclonic areas (see Figure 2.2.3 ) is to ensure the structure has sufficient strength  
to transfer wind forces to the ground with an adequate safety margin to prevent collapse of the building and the building  
being lifted, or slid off its foundations.  
To resist these forces it is necessary to have— 
an anchorage system, where the roof is connected by the walls to the footings by a chain of connections; and  •
a bracing system to prevent horizontal collapse due to wind forces; and  •
continuity of the system where each structural element is interlocked to its adjoining structural element throughout  •
the building.  
 
Explanatory Information : Anchorage 
Anchorage of the system is achieved by using a variety of connectors. Each connector must be capable of carrying the  
uplift force, because the ability of the building to resist the wind forces is directly related to its weakest link.

Surface water  must be diverted away from a Class 1 building as follows:  
Slab-on-ground — finished ground level adjacent to a building: the external finished surface surrounding the  (a)
slab must be drained to move surface water  away from the building and graded to give a slope of not less than  
(see Figure 3.3.3a ) — 
25 mm over the first 1 m from the building—  (i)
in low rainfall intensity areas  for surfaces that are reasonably impermeable (such as concrete or clay  (A)
paving); or  
for any reasonably impermeable surface that forms part of an access path or ramp provided for the  (B)
purposes of Clauses 1.1(2) or (4)(c) of the ABCB Standard for Livable Housing Design; or  
50 mm over the first 1 m from the building in any other case.  (ii)
Slab-on-ground — finished slab heights: the height of the slab-on-ground above external finished surfaces must  (b)
be not less than (see Figure 3.3.3a ) — 
100 mm above the finished ground level in low rainfall intensity areas  or sandy, well-drained areas; or  (i)
50 mm above impermeable (paved or concrete) areas that slope away from the building in accordance with  (ii)
(a); or 
150 mm in any other case.  (iii)The ground beneath suspended floors must be graded so that the area beneath the building is above the adjacent  (c)
external finished ground level and 
surface water  is prevented from ponding under the building (see Figure 3.3.3b ).

Explanatory Information  
The appropriate slab height above finished ground level and the slope of the external finished surface surrounding the  
slab may vary depending on the following:  
The local plumbing requirements; in particular the height of the overflow relief gully relative to drainage  fittings and  •
ground level (to work effectively they must be a minimum of 150 mm below the lowest sanitary fixture).  
The run-off from storms, particularly in areas of high rainfall intensity, and the local topography.  •

 (1 May 2023)
Site preparation
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 35 Figure 3.3.4: Construction of silt pits  
 
 
Explanatory Information  
Subsoil drainage systems may need to be installed where subsurface water movement could damage buildings or  
cause loss of amenity through the build up of excessive moisture or lateral water pressure. Typical locations of subsoil  
drainage systems are on the uphill side of cut and fill sites, adjacent to deep footings, behind retaining walls and adjacent  
to basement walls.  
The design and installation of subsoil drainage systems should take into account the nature of the soil and the anticipated  
water level, quantity and movement. In some cases, detailed investigations involving excavations, field observations  
and soil tests may be necessary to determine the appropriate solution. Typical subsoil drain configurations are shown  
in Figure 3.3.4 (explanatory) . 
In clay soil, subsoil drains can alter the long-term moisture content in the soil, adversely affecting the building foundation  
by removing or, in some cases, introducing water. In such conditions, subsoil drains should only be used where there  
are no other options for dealing with subsoil water.  
Additional guidance on subsoil drainage systems can be found in AS/NZS 3500.3 and AS 2870.  Finished surface

 (1 May 2023)
Site preparation
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 40 
Table Notes  
The entire area beneath the slab must be treated when the slab-on-ground is not designed and constructed in  
accordance with AS 2870 or AS 3600.  
 
Explanatory Information : Validity of test results  
3.4.2(b)(ii) provides the option of having a chemical termite management system tested to AS 3660.3. In order for the  
test results to remain valid, the system would then have to be installed as tested.  
 
Explanatory Information : Component  
A component of a system as referred to in Table 3.4.2  is one that, when used in combination with other components,  
will form a ‘full system’.  
For example, if a concrete slab is used as a component of a system, it in itself will not provide a complete termite  
management system. Depending on the construction methods and the site conditions, additional requirements will be  
necessary for service penetrations through the concrete slab. Each of these are ‘components’, when integrated, will  
form a ‘full system’. 
 
Explanatory Information : Integrity of the termite management system  
There are more than 350 species of termites in Australia, about 30 of which achieve economic importance by causing  
costly damage to building structures. Due to the nature of termites, it is extremely difficult to prevent them gaining  
access to a building.  
In addition to correct installation of a termite management system, its effectiveness will rely on regular maintenance  
and competent inspection.  
 
Explanatory Information : Attachments to buildings 
Attachments referred to in Table 3.4.2  include downpipes, service pipes, steps, verandahs, porches, access ramps,  
carports, trellises, decks, heated water  systems, air-conditioners and the like.  
 
 3.4.3   Durable notice  
[2019: 3.1.4.4]  
A durable notice must be permanently fixed to the building in a prominent location, such as in a meter box or the like,  
indicating—  
the termite management system used; and  (a)
the date of installation of the system; and  (b)
where a chemical is used, its life expectancy as listed on the appropriate authority’s  register label; and  (c)
the installer’s or manufacturer’s recommendations for the scope and frequency of future inspections for termite  (d)
activity.

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 41Explanatory Information : Appropriate authority  
For the purpose of the pesticides register, the appropriate authority  is the government body responsible for the  
registration of pesticides. Currently, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APMVA) coordinates  
the registration scheme.  
 
Explanatory Information : Durable notice 
Where a durable notice is required  by 3.4.3, it must be fixed to the building in a prominent location advising the building  
occupants that the system should be inspected and maintained.  
The notice should be clearly written, on a material that will not deteriorate or fade over time and be located in or near  
the electrical meter box or similar location so that it can be easily seen and read by future owners of the building.  
Additional information may be included if desired by the person placing the notice.  3.4.3

Figure Notes  
Compacted fill must be in accordance with 4.2.4 . 
 
Explanatory Information  
The foundations  of a building are critical to its successful performance. As such, the soil must have the strength or  
bearing capacity to carry the building load with minimum movement.  
The bearing capacity of a soil varies considerably and needs to be determined on a site by site basis. For this to occur,  
the appropriate people need to be consulted. These people may include a qualified engineer or experienced engineering  
geologist, or it may be determined by a person with appropriate local knowledge. The minimum bearing capacity (soil  
strength rating) may depend on the site conditions. The soil may be naturally undisturbed or be disturbed by building  
work or the like. Where soil is disturbed by building work and the like, the bearing capacity can be dramatically altered.  
This is typically the case for sloping sites where cut and fill procedures are used. In these situations the soil needs to  
be consolidated, generally via compaction, to achieve the required  bearing capacity.  
There are a number of alternatives for working on cut and filled sites. These are described in Figure 4.2.5 . 
Option 1 of Figure 4.2.5  refers to the controlled fill  process which involves the compaction of fill in layers to achieve the  
bearing capacity described in 4.2.5. The depth of fill for each layer is specified to ensure effective compaction. Fill  
beyond these depths will need to be installed in accordance with H1D4(1).  
Option 2 and 3 of Figure 4.2.5  refer to edge beams that extend through the fill into undisturbed soil which provides the  
4.2.5 required  bearing capacity. In this situation the fill is essentially only taking the internal slab loads.

[2019: 3.2.3.1]  
Concrete must comply with the following:  
Concrete must comply with AS 3600; and—  (a)
have a strength at 28 days of not less than 20 MPa (denoted as N20 grade); and  (i)
have a 20 mm maximum nominal aggregate size; and  (ii)
have a nominal 100 mm slump.  (iii)
Water must not be added to the mix to increase the slump to a value in excess of that specified.  (b)
Concrete must be placed, compacted and cured in accordance with good building practice.  (c)
 
Explanatory Information  
Complete discharge of the concrete from the truck should be made within one and a half hours of initial mixing with  •
water unless a suitable retarder has been specified.  
Compacting concrete by vibration removes air pockets and works the concrete thoroughly around reinforcement,  •
service penetrations etc. and into corners of formwork to increase durability and resistance to termite infestation  
and salt damp attack. Care should be taken not to over-vibrate. The finishing and curing of slab edges provides an  
improved edge finish which is resistant to edge dampness.  
Care should be taken when using chemical curing methods, because some products may not be compatible with  •
adhesives used to fix surface finishes to the slab.

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 54Explanatory Information : Cleaning and placement of reinforcing  
In order to obtain a good bond between concrete and reinforcement, the reinforcement should be free of contamination  
by mud, paint, oils, etc. It is not necessary for the reinforcement to be completely free of rust. Some rusting is beneficial  
in promoting a good bond as it roughens the surface of the steel. Loose rust, however, must be removed from the  
reinforcement.  
Reinforcement is designed to be in a particular place so as to add strength or to control cracking of the concrete. A  
displacement from its intended location could make a significant difference to the life or serviceability of the structure.

Explanatory Information  
Tables 4.2.17a , 4.2.17b  and 4.2.17c  provide solutions for footings that are equivalent to those supporting a wall type  
that may be different to the actual type included in design documentation. The equivalent wall construction in the right-
hand column of each of these tables recognises the types of footing systems suitable to support the actual external  
wall and internal wall  types that may not have a specific solution for supporting footings.  
 
 4.2.18   Footings for fireplaces on Class A and S sites  
[2019: 3.2.5.5]  
(1) Fireplaces on Class A and S sites must be supported on a pad footing—  
150 mm thick for single storey (one trafficable floor and a wall height not more than 4.2 m) construction; and  (a)
200 mm thick for 2 storey (two trafficable floors and a wall height not more than 8 m) construction; and  (b)
reinforced top and bottom with SL72 mesh; and  (c)
extending 300 mm past the edges of the masonry except for any edge flush with the outer wall.  (d)
(2) The pad footing must form an integral part of the slab.  
 4.2.19   Shrinkage control  
[2019: 3.2.5.3]  
Where brittle floor coverings, such as ceramic tiles, are to be used over an area greater than 16 m2, one of the following  
additional measures must be taken to control the effect of shrinkage cracking—  
the amount of shrinkage reinforcement (steel reinforcement mesh in the slab panel) must be—  (a)
increased to SL92 or equivalent throughout the affected slab area; or  (i)
reinforced top and bottom with sheets of slab mesh throughout the affected slab area; or  (ii)
the bedding system for brittle coverings must be selected on the basis of the expected slab movement and the  (b)
characteristics of the floor covering (including the use of expansion joints etc.); or  
the placement of floor covering must be delayed for not less than 3 months after the concrete has been poured.  (c)
 4.2.20   Concentrated loads

[New for 2022]  
Cavity  masonry walls must not be greater than 8.5 m in height when measured above the adjacent finished ground level . 
 5.3.3   External walls  
[New for 2022]  
(1) Cavity  masonry walls must comply with the relevant provisions of this Part and Parts 5.6  and 5.7, and be constructed  
as follows: 
The height of the wall between lateral supports  (floor or ceiling or roof diaphragm) must be not more than 3 m.  (a)
Cavity  masonry walls subject to wind loads must be supported by masonry cross walls or by steel mullions  (b)
complying with (3).  
Masonry cross walls must be—  (c)
not less than 2 m in length; and  (i)
at not more than 5.1 m centres where the length of the cavity  wall being supported does not contain any  (ii)
opening or control joint; and  
not more than 2.5 m from the edge of a control joint in the length of the cavity  wall being supported; and  (iii)
not more than a distance from the edge of an opening in the length of the cavity  wall being supported as  (iv)
stated in Table 5.3.3 ; and  
located at both edges of openings of width greater than 2.7 m; and  (v)
directly connected to the internal leaf of the cavity  wall being supported using—  (vi)
properly bonded units with at least 90 mm engagement on each side of the interface with the selected  (A)
bond pattern but not less than every fourth course of masonry; or  
medium duty Type A cavity  wall ties in aligning mortar bed joints at a vertical spacing of not more than  (B)
300 mm; and 
connected by a floor or ceiling diaphragm to the wall being supported where floor or ceiling connections  (vii)
are designed in accordance with AS/NZS 4600, AS 1720.1 or AS 3600, as appropriate.  
(2) Cavity  masonry walls must be constructed of two leaves, with each leaf not less than 90 mm wide.  
(3) In cavity  masonry construction, a cavity  must be provided between the inner and outer masonry leaves as follows:  
The cavity  must be not less than 35 mm and not more than 75 mm in width, in accordance with 5.7.2 . (a)
Except for steel mullions, the minimum cavity  width specified in (a) is to be maintained between the outer masonry  (b)
leaf and any insulation or services located in the cavity . 
Where steel mullions are located in a cavity  as permitted by (b), a vertical damp-proof course  must be placed  (c)
between the outer masonry leaf and the mullion to prevent moisture penetration.  Part 5.3 Cavity masonry

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 79 Table 5.3.3: Spacing of return walls for cavity walls with openings — distance from the edge of an  
opening (mm) 
 
Table Notes  
The spacing in wind class N1 is smaller than for N2 because 5.6.5  states that for cavity  walls in wind class N1, light  
duty cavity  ties are to be used. This results in only relying on one leaf to resist the load instead of sharing it equally as  
per clause 7.7.3 of AS 3700. 
 
Explanatory Information  
Steel mullions complying with AS 4773.1 and 4773.2 used to support wind loads may be placed within a cavity . Flat  
ceiling capable of performing diaphragm action may act as lateral support  to walls provided the structure has been  
specifically designed.

provisions of this Part and be—  
not less than 75 mm thick; and (a)
either— (b)
bonded at the junctions of the intersecting walls; or  (i)
provided with an articulation joint in accordance with 5.6.8 . (ii)
(2) Where a vertical articulation joint is provided in an internal masonry wall it must be formed in accordance with 5.6.8 . 
 5.3.5   Openings in cavity masonry  
[New for 2022]  
(1) Except where excluded by (2), openings in cavity  masonry must be spanned by steel lintels in accordance with 5.6.7 . 
(2) Openings in cavity  masonry not more than 500 mm wide need not be provided with a steel lintel provided the opening  
is adequately supported.  
 
Explanatory Information  
An opening of not more than 500 mm is considered to be adequately supported if the masonry bears directly on a  
timber window head or steel frame.

 Figure 6.2.1d : Typical subfloor ventilation details — typical cross ventilation of subfloor area  
 
 
Explanatory Information  
Subfloor ventilation is cross ventilation of the subfloor space between the underside of the subfloor and the ground  
surface under a building.  
Ground moisture rising into or entering the subfloor space can create a damp environment which encourages timber  
rot, fungus growth and the potential for termite activity. Subfloor ventilation increases air flow, reducing any damaging  
water vapour in the subfloor space.  
Factors that can affect achieving satisfactory levels of subfloor ventilation include height above ground, prevailing  
breezes (air transfer), differential temperature and humidity between the subfloor and the external environment and  
good building practice.  
The amount of subfloor ventilation required  for a building is related to the relative humidity likely to be encountered in  
that location. Figure 6.2.1a  shows three broad climatic zones based on the prevailing relative humidity and includes a  
description of the relative humidity conditions which define each zone. If reliable weather data is available, these  
descriptions may be useful in determining which zone a particular location is in.  
The zones shown in Figure 6.2.1a  were determined by analysis of the average relative humidity at 9 am and 3 pm in  
January and July. The season with the highest relative humidity is used. Generally this will be July for southern Australia  
and January for northern Australia.  
Table 6.2.1a  and Table 6.2.1b  specify the minimum amount of subfloor ventilation openings and height of subfloor  
framing members above ground level for the three climatic zones illustrated in Figure 6.2.1a . The table allows subfloor  
ventilation rates to be halved if the ground within the subfloor space is sealed by an impervious membrane  because  
humidity levels in the space will not be affected by moisture from the soil.  
Clause 6.2.1(5) specifies additional requirements for preventing deterioration of subfloor members where the ground  
or subfloor space is excessively damp, as would occur in areas with high water tables, poor drainage or in areas  
frequently affected by flooding or water inundation.  Internal opening

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 134 Figure 6.3.6b : Acceptable load eccentricity for columns  
 
 
Explanatory Information : Cantilever columns  
A cantilever column is not assisted by any lateral bracing element such as a column bracing set, timber or masonry  
wall. 
 
Explanatory Information : Calculating column size  
The following is an example of the steps required to calculate a suitable column to support typical floor loads in a  
residential building. It is proposed the column will—  
have an actual height of 1800 mm; and  •
support a timber floor only; and  •
be square in section; and  •
be cast in to the footings; and •
be fully braced by column bracing sets.  •
Step 1 – Determining effective column height  
The column height (H) is determined by multiplying the actual height by the relevant height factor (F1) in Tables 6.3.6d , 
6.3.6e  or 6.3.6f . In this case, the relevant value for F1 is 1.00 as the column is cast in to the footing and is fully braced.  
Therefore: Load eccentricitye = D/2 + 100 mm

D6.3.6
 (1 May 2023)
Framing
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 135H = actual height x F1  •
H = 1800 mm x F1 •
H = 1800 mm (1.8 m) •
Step 2 – Determine floor area to be supported  
The column position selected is C4 as shown in Figure 6.3.6a  and the dimensions of L1 and L2 are 2700 mm (2.7 m),  
LA is 1900 mm (1.9 m) and LB is 2100 mm (2.1 m). 
The area supported by the column is determined by the formulae set out in Table 6.3.6g . 
Therefore: 
Total area supported (A) is 0.625(L1 + L2) x 0.625(LA + LB)  •
A = 0.625(2.7 m + 2.7 m) x 0.625 x (1.9 m + 2.1 m)  •
A = (0.625 x 5.4 m) x (0.625 x 4.0 m)  •
A = 3.38 m x 2.5 m  •
A = 8.5 m2 •
Step 3 – Select column size from Tables 6.3.6d , 6.3.6e  or 6.3.6f  
The column with an effective height of 1800 mm supporting a floor area of 8.5 m2 is selected from the 10 m2 column in  
Table 6.3.6d  (“0” roof load area) giving a SHS 350 75 x 75 x 3 size.  
It should be noted there is a choice of CHS 250 88.9 x 4 or CHS 350 101.6 x 2.6 should a different section be desired.  
 
 6.3.7   Fixings and bearing for structural steel members  
[New for 2022]  
(1) All bolts used in connections must be hot dip galvanised 300 g/m2. 
(2) Bearer connections must be fixed in accordance with Figure 6.3.7a . 
(3) Joists, bearers and lintels must be restrained from lateral movement or twisting along their length by fixing rafters or  
joists to the top flange of the member so as to prevent the member from moving laterally.  
(4) End supports for bearers and lintels must transfer loads to the footings and have a bearing distance as follows:  
For single spans, the bearing distance must be not less than the width of the member.  (a)
For continuous spans, internal bearing must be not less than two times the width of the member.  (b)
(5) Strutting beams must—

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 140Explanatory Information  
The ends of bearers and lintels must be sufficiently supported to ensure structural loads are transferred to the footing  
system. The amount of horizontal bearing (measured in millimetres) required on the vertical supports will depend on  
the type of span of the bearer or lintel. For single spans, the amount of horizontal bearing is to be equal to or greater  
than the width of the bearer or lintel. For continuous spans it is to be twice the width of the bearer or lintel.  
For bearing distance, see 6.3.7(4)(a) and (b).  
Explanatory Figure 6.3.7  depicts an example of a 200 PFC bearer or lintel supporting floor or roof loads over a single

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 148Table Notes  
Low — remote inland includes dry rural areas remote from the coast or sources of pollution. Many areas of 
Australia (1)
beyond at least 50 km from the sea are in this category
, including most cities and towns such as Canberra, Ballarat,
T
oowoomba, Alice Springs and some suburbs of cities on sheltered bays such as Melbourne, Hobart, Brisbane and
Adelaide that are more than 1 km from the sea. However each of these have many exceptions which are in more
corrosive categories.
Medium — urban inland, coastal or industrial typically coastal areas with low salinity around sheltered bays, such(2)
as Port Phillip Bay
. This extends from about 50 m from the shoreline to a distance of about 1 km inland but
seasonally or in semi-sheltered bays extends 3 to 6 km inland. 
Along ocean front areas with breaking surf  and
significant salt spray
, it extends from 1 km inland to about 10 to 50 km depending on wind direction and topography.
Much of the metropolitan areas of W
ollongong, Sydney, Newcastle, Perth and the Gold Coast are in this category.
This can extend to 30 to 70 km inland in South 
Australia while on some evidence, other southern Australian coastal
zones are in this, or a more severe category
. This also includes urban and industrial areas with low pollution and
for several kilometres around large industries such as steel works and smelters.
High typically occurs on the coast around sheltered bays. Category high extends up to 50 m inland from the(3)
shoreline. In areas of rough seas and surf it extends from several hundred metres to about 1 km inland. 
As with
other categories the extent depends on wind, wave action and topography
. The category will also be found inside
industrial plants and can influence a distance of 1.5 km down wind of the plant.
V
ery high is typical of offshore conditions and is found on the beachfront in regions of rough seas and surf beaches. (4)
It can extend inland for several hundred metres. It is also found in aggressive industrial areas with a pH of less
than 5.
All locations described in the table contain variations of greater corrosion severity
. If significant, this must be (5)
addressed by designing for the most severe environment.
In locations where metallic coatings are not a suitable form of corrosion protection, the roof sheeting must be of a(6)
type that has been designed and manufactured for such environments.

Explanatory Information  
An anti-capillary feature in the side lap of the sheet is used to prevent capillary action drawing moisture into the lap and  
to allow the lap to drain. This can also be achieved by not over tightening the sheet fixing.  
Wherever possible, consideration should be given to laying the metal sheet roofing so that the side lap is facing away  
from prevailing weather.

Explanatory Information  
The requirement to install drainage systems from roofs and sub-soil drains should be confirmed with the appropriate  •
authority . These provisions need only be applied when drainage systems are necessary.  
Information on drainage requirements outside the allotment can be obtained from the appropriate authority . •
Where box gutters are proposed to be installed, AS/NZS 3500.3 may be used to calculate minimum sizes, falls and  •
overflow requirements.  
For Class 10 buildings, it may not be necessary to comply with the requirements for removing surface water  where  •
the Class 10 building is not connected to or does not impact a Class 1 building. For example, where a Class 10  
garage is attached to a Class 1 dwelling, the run-off from the garage would most likely directly impact the dwelling  
and therefore be required  to be removed. However, a garage that is separated by a reasonable distance from the  
dwelling so as to not have an impact would not necessarily have to comply with the requirements for removal of  
surface water. 
The following are a number of other Clauses and Parts of the ABCB Housing Provisions that contain requirements  •
related to drainage and roofing in addition to the provisions of this Part:  
7.5.8  for parapet cappings.  ◾
7.3.6  for water discharge.  ◾
7.2.7  for flashings  and cappings as they relate to penetrations through roofs.  ◾
Part 3.3  for drainage . ◾
 
Explanatory Information : Design of stormwater drainage systems  
Stormwater drainage systems specified in the NCC Volume Two and the ABCB Housing Provisions are not designed  
to remove all water to an appropriate outfall during exceptionally heavy rain, particularly in tropical areas. Specifically,  
eaves gutter systems are designed to remove water arising from rainfall events with an annual exceedance probability  
of 5% provided they are not blocked.  
Accordingly, it is necessary to design and install the system to incorporate overflow measures so that when overflowing  
occurs, during a rainfall event with an annual exceedance probability  of up to 1%, any water is directed away in a  
manner which ensures it does not pond against, enter or damage the building, even if the stormwater drainage system  
is blocked.  
Insufficient and poorly located downpipes are a frequent cause of poor roof drainage system performance. The  
installation of downpipes, especially near valley gutters, is designed to ensure rainwater from areas on the roof that  
have concentrated water flows is adequately removed.  
Particular consideration needs to be given to box gutters, valley gutters etc. located above the internal areas of a  
building. There are several options available to designers using the requirements of NCC Volume Two and the ABCB  
Housing Provisions. The designer will need to choose an overflow system that will cope with the rainfall intensity for the  
particular location. Consideration needs to be given to the total capacity of overflow measures on lower level roofs  
where overflow measures adopted for a higher roof catchment will result in overflow to a lower one. Overflow discharge  
onto lower roofs may also require consideration of sarking, flashing and other weatherproofing precautions to the lower  
roof area.  
The acceptable overflow measures in Table 7.4.4a  and Table 7.4.4b  were calculated using the following formulas:

Table Notes  
Locations used in this table are based on the nearest Bureau of Meteorology grid cell latitude and longitude to the  
central Post Office of each city or town. 
 
Explanatory Information  
The cross sectional area referred to in Table 7.4.3b  is measured up to the lowest part of the relevant overflow facility  
including the lower edge of a slot, gutter back, end-stop weir, inverted nozzle, front-face weir or overflow opening in a  
rainhead.  
 
Explanatory Information : Worked example — determining appropriate overflow measures  
The location of a proposed building is in Wollongong, NSW. Using Table 7.4.3d  the 5 minute duration rainfall intensity  
for a 1% annual exceedance probability  is 311 mm/h. The 5 minute duration rainfall intensities in Table 7.4.4a  and Table  
7.4.4b  are provided in 25 mm/h increments, therefore for the purpose of the worked example 325 mm/h will be used.  
Table 7.4.4a  and Table 7.4.4b  provide required  overflow volumes in both litres per second for dedicated overflow  
measures and litres per second per metre for continuous overflow measures. Extrapolation of the values in these tables  
can be used to inform a Performance Solution  complying with the Governing Requirements of the NCC. Where both  
dedicated and continuous measures are proposed, Table 7.4.4b  can be used to determine the required  overflow volume.  
Multiple overflow measures are proposed to be used with a roof catchment area of 60 m2, incorporating a 10 m (1)
eaves gutter. 
Using Table 7.4.4b  for a 325 mm/h 5 minute duration rainfall intensity, the overflow volume in litres per second  (2)
(L/s) for a roof catchment area of 60 m2 is 5.4 L/s. 
Select an acceptable dedicated overflow measure from 7.4.7 .  (3)
The selected dedicated overflow measure is an end-stop weir which provides 0.5 L/s.  (a)
One end-stop weir does not achieve the required  overflow volume of 5.4 L/s, and additional overflow measures  (b)
are required  to remove the overflow volume.  
To achieve the required  overflow volume a continuous overflow measure is also selected from 7.4.6 . (4)
A front face slotted gutter is the selected overflow measure as it provides 0.5 L/s/m.  (a)State Locality Annual exceedance

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 171Taking account of the eaves gutter length (10 m), the combined overflow measures (0.5 L/s for the end-stop  (b)
weir and 0.5 L/s/m × 10 m) will remove up to 5.5 L/s.  
The 5.5 L/s capacity provided by the selected overflow measures exceeds the required  5.4 L/s overflow volume.  (5)
 
 7. 4. 4   Installation of gutters  
[2019: 3.5.3.4]  
(1) Eaves gutters must be— 
installed with a fall of not less than 1:500; and  (a)
supported by brackets securely fixed at stop ends, corners and at not more than 1.2 m centres; and  (b)
fitted with overflow measures capable of removing the overflow volume specified in Table 7.4.4a  and Table  (c)
7.4.4b . 
(2) Overflow measures in accordance with 7.4.6  and 7.4.7  are deemed to be capable of removing the overflow volume  
specified in those provisions.  
(3) Where the overflow volume values for ridge-to-gutter lengths in Table 7.4.4a  and roof catchment areas in Table 7.4.4b  
are not stated, interpolation may be used to determine the applicable overflow values.  
(4) Valley gutters must— 
be installed on a roof with a pitch more than 12.5 degrees; and  (a)
have dimensions in accordance with Table 7.4.4c  for the relevant rainfall intensity; and  (b)
have minimum freeboard of not less than 15 mm; and  (c)
have a side angle of not less than 12.5 degrees.  (d)
(5) The requirement of (1)(c) does not apply to eaves gutters fixed to a verandah or an eave that is greater than 450 mm  
in width, which—  
has no lining; or  (a)
is a raked verandah or a raked eave with a lining sloping away from the building.  (b)

 7.5.6   Flashings to wall openings  
[2019: 3.5.4.6]  
Openings in external wall  cladding exposed to the weather must be flashed with materials complying with AS/NZS 2904  
and in accordance with the following:  
Flashings  must be provided to bottom, tops and sides of openings, except as permitted by (d), and must be  (a)
installed so that the flashing — 
extends not less than 110 mm beyond the reveals on each side of the opening where practicable; and  (i)
is attached to the window  and wall framing; and  (ii)
at the top and bottom of the opening, drains to the outside face of the wall or cladding.  (iii)
Joins in the flashing  must—  (b)
overlap by not less than 75 mm in the direction of flow; and  (i)
be securely fastened at intervals of not more than 40 mm; and  (ii)
have sealant installed between laps.  (iii)
The method of flashing  must be suitable for the framing and cladding used and any reveal for the window  or (c)
door system or any architrave or finishing trims that may be installed.  
The top of an opening need not be flashed where it is adequately protected by an eave of a width more than 3  (d)
times the height of the cladding above the opening (See Figure 7.5.6 ). 
Flashings  must be securely fixed at least 25 mm under the cladding and extend over the ends and edges of the  (e)
framing of the opening.  (a) Masonry-veneer construction (b) Clad frame constructionHanger

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 185 Figure 7 .5.6: Weather protection of openings  
Explanatory Information  
7.5.6(a)(i) applies ‘where practicable’ because it is often impractical to extend the flashing  110 mm beyond the reveal;  
for example, where openings are positioned adjacent to a corner or where two windows  are within 110 mm of each  
other. In such cases consideration should be given to ensure the flashing  prevents the penetration of water into the  
external wall .

 7.5.8   Parapet cappings  
[2019: 3.5.4.8]  
Where a wall cladding is used to form a parapet wall, the cladding must be attached to a supporting frame and have a  
capping installed that complies with the following:  
Cappings must—  (a)
be purpose made, machine-folded sheet metal or equivalent sections of a material compatible with all up  (i)
and downstream metal roof covering materials in accordance with 7.2.2(2) ; and  
extend not less than 50 mm down the sides of the parapet; and  (ii)
be separated from the supporting framing by a vapour permeable sarking installed in accordance with (f);  (iii)
and 
be fixed with either self drilling screws or rivets with rubber washers at intervals of not more than 500 mm  (iv)
that do not penetrate the top of cappings, except at joints and corners.  
The top of the capping must slope a minimum of 5 degrees.  (b)
Joints in cappings must—  (c)
overlap by not less than 50 mm in the direction of flow; and  (i)
be securely fastened at intervals of not more than 40 mm; and  (ii)
have sealant installed between laps.  (iii)
Fixing for cappings must be compatible with the capping material in accordance with 7.2.2 . (d)
Lead cappings must not be used with prepainted steel or zinc/aluminium steel or on any roof if the roof is part  (e)
of a drinking water  catchment area.  
Sarking must comply with AS 4200.1 and be installed behind all wall cladding where parapets are installed,  (f)
with— 
each adjoining sheet or roll being—  (i)
overlapped not less than 150 mm; or  (A)
taped together; and  (B)
sarking fixed to supporting members at not more than 300 mm centres.  (i)
 
Explanatory Information  
For the purposes of 7.5.8(f), sarking is required  to be installed to the whole external wall  which contains the parapet  
and extend to the top and back of the parapet. A gap should be provided between the sarking and the parapet capping  
to help control condensation . 7.5.7

 8.1.1   Scope 
[New for 2022]  
This Section sets out the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions  for—  
windows  and external glazed doors (see Part 8.2 ); and  (a)
glass (see Part 8.3 ); and  (b)
glazing human impact (see Part 8.4 ). (c)
 
Explanatory Information  
These provisions relate to the design, manufacture and installation of windows  in external walls  and the use of glass in  
Class 1 and 10 buildings. The selection of glass in Part 8.3  applies to other assemblies that may not be in an external  
wall of a Class 1 or 10 building.  
The terms windows  and glazed assemblies are used throughout Section 8. The term window  is defined in the NCC and  
relates to a device which is capable of transmitting natural light directly from outside a building or room when it is in the  
closed position. This is distinct from glazed assemblies which may also include elements located in internal parts of a  
building. These may be glazed panels, splash-backs, mirrors, shower screens or window -type assemblies that are not  
subject to wind loads and weatherproofing requirements.  
A number of other parts of NCC Volume Two and the ABCB Housing Provisions also contain requirements relating to  
glazing in addition to this Part. They include:  
H1D5 of NCC Volume Two and Part 5.2  of the ABCB Housing Provisions for flashing  material requirements.  •
H7D2 of NCC Volume Two for glazed barriers for swimming pool  enclosures.  •
H7D4 for windows  in buildings in designated bushfire prone areas . •
Part 13.3  of the ABCB Housing Provisions for glazing subject to energy efficiency requirements.  •
 
 8.1.2   Application

The Governing Requirements of NCC Volume Two.  (a)
The State and Territory variations, additions and deletions contained in the Schedules to the ABCB Housing  (b)
Provisions and NCC Volume Two.  
 
Explanatory Information  
In NCC 2019, the content of Section 8 of the ABCB Housing Provisions (other than content added in NCC 2022 or later)  
was contained in the acceptable construction practice for Part 3.6 of NCC 2019 Volume Two.  Part 8.1 Scope and application of Section 8

 8.2.1   Application  
[New for 2022]  
Part 8.2  applies subject to the limitations set out in H1D8(1) and (2).  
 
Explanatory Information  
This Part does not cover the installation of assemblies that are internal or revolving doors, fixed louvres, skylights, 
rooflights and windows  not installed in the vertical plane, windows  in greenhouses or horticultural buildings or frameless  
sliding doors.  
The term ‘one piece framing’ in H1D8(1)(a)(iv) generally refers to glazing installed in the external wall  of a building  
where the external fabric is forming the frame.  
 
 8.2.2   Installation of windows  
[New for 2022]  
Windows  must be installed in accordance with the following:  
Structural building loads must not be transferred to the window  assembly.  (a)
A minimum 10 mm gap must be provided between the top of the window  assembly and any loadbearing  framing  (b)
or masonry wall element.  
The requirements of (b) may be increased where necessary to allow for frame settlement over wide openings.  (c)
Packing, if provided between each window  assembly and the frame, must be—  (d)
located along each side and bottom; and  (i)
fixed to ensure the sides and bottom of the window  assembly remain straight; and  (ii)
clear of any flashing  material.  (iii)
 
Explanatory Information  
It is important for windows  to be fixed correctly in the external frame or wall of a building to prevent buckling, diagonal  
distortion or twisting that may compromise weathertightness around the perimeter of the opening. Correct installation  
is also critical to ensure windows  resist design wind pressures that the external walls  of the building are subject to over  
its expected life and transfer the resultant forces only to the framing members beside the window . Consideration should  
be given to any additional details for systems designed specifically to meet acoustic or energy efficiency requirements.  
Window  assemblies should be installed so they are as close as possible to being perpendicular with the vertical and  
horizontal planes and where all corners form right-angles, have equal distances when measured diagonally to ensure  
they are square.  
A gap provided between the top of the assembly and the external wall  frame will allow for settlement after construction  
and prevent the transfer of structural loads. Where packing is used between the openings in the external wall  and the  
window  assembly, it should be of a material that is compatible with both the frame and the window  assembly. It should  
also be positioned and fixed to stay in place permanently and ensure the sides and sills remain straight.  
Where aluminium sills of a window  assembly may contact masonry, particularly mortar, an isolating material such as  
bituminous membranes  or paints and caulking compounds containing zinc chromates should be used. Care must be  
taken to minimise any gaps between sills and external skins to prevent excessive ingress of water.

 8.3.1   Application  
[New for 2022]  
Glazing must comply with the following:  
8.3.2  for glass sizes and installation.  (a)
8.3.3  for fully framed glazing installed in the perimeter of buildings.  (b)
Part 8.4  for glazed assemblies subject to human impact.  (c)
Glass used must be of a type within the scope of AS 1288.  (d)
Glass used in barriers, except a window  serving as a barrier, must withstand loading forces in accordance with  (e)
AS 1170.1. 
Safety glass must be— (f)
legibly marked in accordance with 8.4.7 ; and  (i)
made visible in accordance with 8.4.8 . (ii)
 
Explanatory Information  
This Part applies to the selection of glass only and does not include the installation of windows  or framed glazed  •
doors. This is due to window  systems relying on the design and testing of structural members to withstand wind  
loads (e.g. mullions, transoms, and meeting rails and stiles) and the perimeter frame design, sealants and gaskets  
to resist water penetration.  
This Part does not cover glazing in assemblies that are constructed on site and are architectural one-off windows  •
which are not design tested in accordance with AS 2047 or other assemblies that are second-hand, reused, recycled  
or heritage.  
Information on design wind speed  for particular areas may be available from the appropriate authority . •
For glazing in high wind areas , refer to Part 2.2 . •
 
 8.3.2   Glazing sizes and installation  
[2019: 3.6.2]  
Glazing used in buildings must comply with the following:  
Glazing used in the perimeter of buildings  and supported on all sides must comply with the appropriate provisions  (a)
listed in 8.3.3 . 
Glazing used in areas where the potential for human impact could occur must comply with the appropriate  (b)
provisions listed in Part 8.4 . 
For 3 mm monolithic annealed glass, the maximum area must not be more than 0.85 m2. (c)
 
Explanatory Information  
The selection of glass thickness relies not just on limit state wind loads but on a number of geometric criteria that include  
the influence of aspect ratio and slenderness factors. These factors are taken into account in Tables 8.3.3a , 8.3.3b  and 
8.3.3c .

For monolithic annealed patterned glass thickness measurement refer to 
AS 1288. •
The thickness of glass in Tables 8.3.3a , 8.3.3b  and 8.3.3c  is dependent on the wind classification of the site, Ultimate •
Limit State (ULS) wind pressure set out in AS 4055, and the dimensions of the glass panel. AS 4055 has higher
ULS wind pressures for parts of external walls  within 1200 mm of external corners. The thickness of glass in Tables
8.3.3a , 8.3.3b  and 8.3.3c  is based on these higher ULS wind pressures and can also be used for glass in the
general length of walls.Edge

(1) If the presence of glazing in a door, side panel or panel capable of being mistaken for a doorway or opening is not  
made apparent in accordance with 8.4.4(2)(c) , the glass must be marked to make it readily visible in accordance with  
(2). 
(2) Marking must be in the form of an opaque band not less than 20 mm in height located so that—  
the upper edge is not less than 700 mm above the floor; and  (a)
the lower edge is not more than 1.2 m above the floor.  (b)
(3) A band or marking is not required  where any of the following applies:  
The height of the glazing is not more than 1 m in any part.  (a)
The width of the glazing panel is not more than 500 mm in any part.  (b)
There is no glazing within 500 mm of the floor.  (c)
The glazing is provided with not less than one fixed glazing bar which must—  (d)
be firmly attached to the stiles to locate and protect each face of the glass; and  (i)
be located with its upper edge not less than 500 mm and its bottom edge not more than 1 m above the  (ii)
floor; and 
have a face width not less than 40 mm.  (iii)
 
Explanatory Information  
Making the glass visible by marking is not a substitute for the use of safety glazing in accordance with this Part.  •
A broken line or patterns may be an acceptable form of marking provided it meets the criteria set out in 8.4.7(2).  •
 
 8.4.8   Identification of safety glass  
[New for 2022]  
All safety glazing material in Tables 8.4.2  and Table 8.4.6  installed in accordance with this Part must comply with the  
following:  
Safety glass must be marked in the form of either permanent etching or a label that cannot be reused once  (a)
removed. 
The permanent etching or label must state the following information:  (b)
The Standard to which the safety glass has been tested.  (i)
Registered name of the manufacturer or supplier.  (ii)
Grade of the safety glass. (iii)
Nominal thickness of the safety glass.  (iv)
The type of safety glass. (v)
 
Explanatory Information  
The labelling of safety glass is not intended to remain after completion of construction. Labelling complying with 8.4.8  
should remain in place on safety glass to allow relevant practitioners to confirm and certify that the correct type of safety  8.4.6
 (1 May 2023)
Glazing
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 199glass has been installed in a specific area of the building.  
If a label is able to be removed from the glass, it must be comprised of a material that self-destructs upon removal so  
as to prevent it being reused on other glass panels.  
The type of safety glass can be identified in a way that describes the type used such as “L” for laminated glass or “T”  
for toughened glass, etc.  8.4.8

Explanatory Information  
A Performance Solution  must be used where an external wall  required  to be fire-resisting  does not commence in  •
accordance with 9.2.3(1)(a).  
The intent of the typical construction details shown in Figures 9.2.3a  and b are to ensure that combustible  materials  •

Explanatory Information  
9.2.4(1)(a) ensures that when a Class 10 building is located between an allotment boundary and a Class 1 building or  
another building on the same allotment, either directly or indirectly, that the Class 1 building be protected by a wall with  
an FRL. 
The intention is to prevent the spread of fire from an allotment boundary ( fire source feature ) to a Class 1 building via  
a Class 10a building. Where a Class 10a building is not sited directly and wholly between the allotment boundary and  
the Class 1 building (see 9.2.5 ), the potential of fire spreading from the allotment boundary to the Class 1 still exists.  
Therefore, fire separation would be required . 
9.2.4 does not apply to a boundary that adjoins a road or public space such as parklands, lakes, rivers and the like  
where the construction of buildings is unlikely.

Explanatory Information  
For the purposes of 9.3.2 and 10.7.2 , a reference to a separating wall  includes a wall that separates a Class 1 building  
from a Class 10a building that is not associated with the Class 1 building.  
It is important that any opening in a separating wall  between Class 1 buildings does not allow the free passage of fire  
between buildings. Many designs would require the installation of openings for electrical cables and outlets in these  
walls. 9.3.2 therefore allows such openings provided they comply with the requirements of that provision.  
A reference to a hollow separating wall  in 9.3.2(4) may include a stud wall, masonry cavity  wall or a wall of hollow  
blockwork.  
Part 10.7  (sound insulation) also contains requirements relevant to separating walls , in addition to the provisions of this  
Part. This includes installation requirements for walls and services to achieve appropriate levels of sound insulation.

 9.5.1   Smoke alarm requirements  
[2019: 3.7.5.2]  
Smoke alarms must— 
be located in— (a)
a Class 1a building in accordance with 9.5.2  and 9.5.4 ; and (i)
a Class 1b building in accordance with 9.5.3  and 9.5.4 ; and (ii)
comply with 
AS 3786, except that in a Class 10a private garage  where the use of the area is likely to result in (b)
smoke alarms causing spurious signals, any other alarm deemed suitable in accordance with 
AS 1670.1 may
be installed provided that smoke alarms complying with 
AS 3786 are installed elsewhere in the Class 1 building;
and
be powered from the consumer mains source where a consumer mains source is supplied to the building; and (c)
be interconnected where there is more than one alarm. (d)
Explanatory Information  
A smoke alarm can give spurious alarms if the atmosphere contains particles which obscure vision, such as could occur  
in a Class 10a private garage  part of a building. 9.5.1(b) therefore allows the use of a more suitable alarm, such as a  
heat alarm, in these locations.  
9.5.1(d) requires alarms to be interconnected where there is more than one alarm. This only applies within a single  
dwelling. Therefore, alarms in a Class 1a dwelling need not be interconnected with alarms in another dwelling or a  
private garage  which does not belong to the Class 1a dwelling.  
 9.5.2   Location – Class 1a buildings  
[2019: 3.7.5.3]  
In a Class 1a building, smoke alarms must be located in—  
any storey containing bedrooms, every corridor or hallway associated with a bedroom, or if there is no corridor (a)
or hallway
, in an area between the bedrooms and the remainder of the building; and
each other storey not containing bedrooms. (b)

Where a smoke alarm is located on the ceiling it must be— (a)
a minimum of 300 mm away from the corner junction of the wall and ceiling; and (i)
between 500 mm and 1500 mm away from the high point and apexes of the ceiling, if the room has a sloping (ii)
ceiling.

Fire safety
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 239 
Explanatory Information  
Smoke alarms need to be located on (or near) the ceiling for optimum detection of smoke in a fire situation with special  
care taken to avoid dead air spaces. A dead air space is an area in which trapped hot air will prevent smoke from  
reaching the alarm. This space generally occurs at the apex of cathedral ceilings, the corner junction of walls and  
ceilings and between exposed joists etc. (see Explanatory Figure 9.5.4 ). 
Smoke alarms may be located on the wall in accordance with 9.5.4(b). Explanatory Figure 9.5.4  provides location criteria  
and the dimensional relationship to building elements and the associated dead air spaces.

 9.5.5   Lighting to assist evacuation – Class 1b buildings 
[2019: 3.7.5.6]  
In a Class 1b building, a system of lighting must be installed to assist evacuation of occupants in the event of a fire, and—  
be activated by the smoke alarm required  by 9.5.3(b) ; and  (a)
consist of— (b)
a light incorporated within the smoke alarm; or  (i)
the lighting located in the corridor, hallway or area served by the smoke alarm.  (ii)
 
Explanatory Information  
The lighting required  by 9.5.5 may consist of artificial lighting which may already be installed in a corridor, hallway or  
area, provided that the lighting is activated by the smoke alarm. However consideration should be given to ensure that  
the lighting is not controlled by a dimmer or timer controlled switch which may dim the level of light to an ineffective  
level, or switch the light off before occupants have time to evacuate.  Key:

Explanatory Information : General requirements for Explanatory Figure 10.5.1  
Required  window(s)  to provide natural light must have a light transmitting area of at least 10% of the floor area . 
10% of 100 m2 = 10 m2 
Or, roof light(s)  to provide natural light must have a light transmitting area of at least 3% of the floor area . 
3% of 100 m2 = 3 m2  
In the formula shown in the next Explanatory Information box, 3% of the floor area  is expressed as the fraction 0.03  
and 10% of the floor area  is expressed as the fraction 0.1.

Explanatory Information : Natural light borrowed from another source  
Direct natural light provided from another source is intended to mean light from a window  or roof light  in the subject  •
room. As the provision relates to natural light obtained from an adjoining room, ‘another source’ refers to direct  
natural light provided to the subject room which does not meet the required  allowance of either 10% or 3% of the  
floor area  of that room. By not meeting the required  amount of natural light, the ‘direct natural light from another  
source’ can be used as a supplement to the natural light required  from an adjoining room.  
To borrow natural light from another room, 10.5.1(4)(a) allows light to pass through a glazed panel(s) or opening(s)  •
from an adjoining room, which under 10.5.1(4)(b), must have windows , roof lights  or a combination of windows and  
roof lights  of a minimum size in proportion to the combined floor areas of both rooms. The minimum size of the  
glazed panel(s) or opening(s), and the minimum size of the window  to the adjoining room are illustrated in Figure  
10.5.1 . 
If a doorway is used as an opening to obtain natural light, it must do so when in the closed position (see Figure  •
10.5.1 ).

Explanatory Information  
The ventilating area of a window  is measured as the size of the openable sash of the window . This is the case regardless  
of the type of window , i.e. whether it is an awning, casement or sliding window  and irrespective of the restrictions on  
the openable sash.  
10.6.2(b) permits a room’s required  ventilation to be ‘borrowed’ from an adjoining room, i.e. an adjoining room’s  
ventilation can be used to help make up the total amount of ventilation required . 
The use of borrowed ventilation is acceptable if the provisions of 10.6.2(b) are applied to the subject room and to the  
total area of each relevant room.  
 
 10.6.3   Location of sanitary compartments

The Rw + Ctr sound insulation rating required  by 10.7.1(1)(a)  must—  
be determined in accordance with AS/NZS ISO 717.1, using results from laboratory measurements; or  (a)
comply with 10.7.5  to 10.7.8  and the relevant provisions of 10.7.3 . (b)
 
Explanatory Information  
Rw is a measure of airborne sound insulation. Ctr is a spectrum adjustment factor that adjusts for low frequency sound  
levels. Ctr has been chosen in recognition of the problems caused by the high bass frequency outputs of modern home  
theatre systems and music reproduction equipment used by occupants of Class 1 buildings.  
The wall configurations described in 10.7.5  to 10.7.8  are typical examples. Other proprietary methods are available via  
testing to AS/NZS ISO 717.1 for meeting the Rw + Ctr requirements of 10.7.1 . 
 
 10.7 .3   Construction of sound insulated walls  
[2019: 3.8.6.4]  
To achieve the appropriate level of sound insulation, walls must be constructed as follows:  
Stud wall junction — junctions of sound insulated walls with any perimeter walls and roof cladding must be sealed  (a)
in accordance with Figure 10.7.3a . 
Masonry — units must be laid with all joints filled solid, except for articulation joints complying with 5.6.8 , including  (b)
those between the masonry and any adjoining construction.  
Concrete panels — must have joints between panels and any adjoining construction filled solid.  (c)
Plasterboard sheeting —  (d)
If two layers are required , the second layer joints must not coincide with those of the first layer (see Figure  (i)
10.7.3b ). 
Joints between sheets including the outer layer or between sheets and any adjoining construction must be  (ii)
taped and filled solid.  
Steel framed construction — steel framing and perimeter members must be installed as follows:  (e)
Steel framing members must be not less than 0.6 mm thick.  (i)
Studs must be not less than 63 mm in depth unless another depth is specified in 10.7.5  to 10.7.8 . (ii)
All steel members at the perimeter of the wall must be securely fixed to the adjoining structure and the  (iii)
joints must be caulked so that there are no voids between the steel members and the wall.  
Timber-framed construction — timber studs and perimeter members must be installed as follows:  (f)
Noggings and like members must not bridge between studs supporting different wall leaves.  (i)
All timber members at the perimeter of the wall must be securely fixed to the adjoining structure and the  (ii)
joints must be caulked so there are no voids between the timber members and the wall.  10.7 .2

primary insulation layer  of an external wall  it must have a vapour permeance  of not less than—  
in climate zones  4 and 5, 0.143 µg/N.s; and  (a)
in climate zones  6, 7 and 8, 1.14 µg/N.s.  (b)
(3) Except for single skin masonry or single skin concrete, where a pliable building membrane  is not installed in an  
external wall , the primary water control layer  must be separated from water sensitive materials  by a drained cavity.  
 
Explanatory Information  
10.8.1(2) requires some wall materials on the external side of the primary insulation layer  to have a minimum level of  
vapour permeance . Vapour permeance  is measured in µg/N.s (micrograms per newton-second).  
Class 3 and Class 4 vapour control membranes (as defined by clause 5.3.4 of AS 4200.1) meet the vapour permeance  
requirements of 10.8.1(2)(a), while Class 4 vapour control membranes meet the vapour permeance  requirements of  
10.8.1(2)(b). 
Open-cell insulation, such as mineral wool or fibreglass, typically has a high vapour permeance , while closed-cell  
insulation such as polystyrene typically has a low vapour permeance . Many foil-faced insulation products have a low  
vapour permeance . 
 
 10.8.2   Exhaust systems  
[2019: 3.8.7.3]  
(1) An exhaust system installed in a kitchen, bathroom, sanitary compartment  or laundry must have a minimum flow rate  
of— 
25 L/s for a bathroom or sanitary compartment ; and  (a)
40 L/s for a kitchen or laundry. (b)
(2) Exhaust from a kitchen, kitchen range hood, bathroom, sanitary compartment  or laundry must discharge directly or  
via a shaft or duct to outdoor air . 
(3) Where a venting clothes dryer is installed, it must discharge directly or via a shaft or duct to outdoor air . 
(4) An exhaust system that is not run continuously and is serving a bathroom or sanitary compartment  that is not ventilated  
in accordance with 10.6.2(a)  must—  
be interlocked with the room’s light switch; and  (a)
include a run-on timer so that the exhaust system continues to operate for 10 minutes after the light switch is  (b)
turned off. 
(5) Except for rooms that are ventilated in accordance with 10.6.2(a) , a room with an exhaust system in accordance with  
(1) must be provided with make-up air—  
via openings to an adjacent room with a free area of 14,000 mm2; or (a)
in accordance with AS 1668.2.  (b)Part 10.8 Condensation management

(3) must be provided with make-up air in accordance with AS 1668.2.  
 
Explanatory Information  
A range hood installed in a kitchen must comply with 10.8.2(2).  
10.8.2(3) requires venting clothes dryers to be provided with exhaust ducting directly from the clothes dryer to outdoor  
air. This requirement only applies to venting clothes dryers and not other types of clothes dryers, such as condensing  
clothes dryers. 
10.8.2(5) and 10.8.2(6) requires some rooms that have exhaust systems and are not naturally ventilated (e.g. rooms  
without openable windows) to be provided with make-up air. The make-up air openings required  by 10.8.2(5)(a) are  
based on the minimum flow rates of 10.8.2(1). An opening with a free area of 14,000 mm2 can by achieved by a 20 mm  
undercut to a 700 mm wide door. If the exhaust flowrates exceed the minimum flowrates of 10.8.2(1), additional make-
up air openings may be required for the correct operation of the exhaust system.  
 
 10.8.3   Ventilation of roof spaces  
[2019: 3.8.7.4]  
(1) In climate zones  6, 7 and 8, a roof must have a roof space that—  
is located—  (a)
immediately above the primary insulation layer ; or (i)
immediately above sarking with a vapour permeance  of not less than 1.14 μg/N.s, which is immediately  (ii)
above the primary insulation layer ; or 
immediately above ceiling insulation that meets the requirements of 13.2.3(3)  and 13.2.3(4) ; and  (iii)
has a height of not less than 20 mm; and  (b)
is either— (c)
ventilated to outdoor air  through evenly distributed openings in accordance with Table 10.8.3 ; or (i)
located immediately underneath the roof tiles of an unsarked tiled roof.  (ii)
(2) The requirements of (1) do not apply to a—  
concrete roof; or (a)
roof that is made of structural insulated panels; or  (b)
roof that is subject to Bushfire Attack Level FZ requirements in accordance with AS 3959.  (c)

Explanatory Information : Not more than 18 and not less than 2 risers  
11.2.2(1)(a) states that a stairway must have not more than 18 and not less than 2 risers  in each flight . Where there are  
less than 2 risers  in a flight , it does not comprise a stairway for the purpose of the NCC. 18 risers is considered to be  
the maximum reasonable number that an average person can negotiate before requiring a rest. Winders are counted  
as part of the maximum number of 18 risers . More than 1 riser is considered necessary for a person to observe and  
adjust to a change in level.  
 
Explanatory Information : Going and riser dimensions  
The purpose of 11.2.2 is to achieve constant going  and riser dimensions deemed safe for people to walk up and down.  
This minimises the risk of people overstepping during descent on uneven stairs (due to short goings ) and tripping on  
ascent (due to high risers ). Table 11.2.2a  and Table 11.2.2b  express ratios between going  and riser dimensions which  
are considered safe for use. 11.2.2(1)(c) accounts for conditions such as movement of materials due to atmospheric  
moisture changes or minor deviations related to variations in materials which affect finished stair dimensions.  
Explanatory Figure 11.2.2a  illustrates adjacent risers  within a flight  with minor deviations in the materials affecting the  
finished stair dimensions. The nominated riser height is exceeded by riser A. As a consequence riser height B is less  
than the nominated riser height. The difference between riser A and riser B cannot exceed 5 mm.  
Explanatory Figure 11.2.2b  illustrates an entire flight  with minor deviations in the materials affecting the finished riser 
dimensions. In addition to the 5 mm difference permitted between adjacent goings  or risers , the maximum difference  
between the smallest and largest going  or riser within a flight  must not exceed 10 mm. Despite the deviations shown in  
both diagrams, the stairs in the flight are deemed constant. Irrespective of any minor deviations permitted by 11.2.2(1)(c),  
finished going  and riser dimensions must not exceed the limitations stipulated in Table 11.2.2a . 125 mm

Explanatory Information : Openings in stair risers  
11.2.2(1)(d) allows the use of open riser stairs. However, it limits the openings to 125 mm to minimise the risk of a  
person (especially a young child) falling through the opening created by the open riser. 
 
Explanatory Information : Solid treads 
11.2.2(1)(e) specifies a height where solid treads must be used so that people cannot see through them. This minimises  
the risk of people being affected by vertigo.

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 296Explanatory Information : Stairways with winders  
11.2.2(3) allows the use of winders  in stairways. However, 11.2.2(3) places a restriction on the number of allowable  •
winders  in a stairway flight , this restriction would apply equally to not permit a stairway incorporating a consecutive  
series of winders  in a flight . 
This also means the maximum number of consecutive winders  in any stairway flight  is 6.  •
 
 11.2.3   Ramps  
[2019: 3.9.1.3]  
An external ramp serving an external doorway or a ramp within a building must—  
be designed to take loading forces in accordance with AS/NZS 1170.1; and  (a)
have a gradient not steeper than 1:8; and  (b)
be provided with landings  complying with 11.2.5  at the top and bottom of the ramp and at intervals not greater  (c)
than 15 m. 
 
Notes: Livable housing design 
Where an external ramp is provided for the purposes of compliance with the ABCB Standard for Livable Housing Design,  
the requirements of that Standard apply.  
 
Explanatory Information  
In relation to external ramps, 11.2.3 applies to a ramp serving an external door. For the purpose of 11.2.3 a driveway is  
not considered to be a ramp.  
 
 11.2.4   Slip resistance  
[2019: 3.9.1.4]  
(1) The requirements for slip-resistance treatment to stair treads, ramps and landings  are as set out in (2), (3) and (4).  
(2) Treads must have— 
a surface with a slip-resistance classification not less than that listed in Table 11.2.4  when tested in accordance  (a)
with AS 4586; or 
a nosing strip with a slip-resistance classification not less than that listed in Table 11.2.4  when tested in  (b)
accordance with AS 4586.  
(3) The floor surface of a ramp must have a slip-resistance classification not less than that listed in Table 11.2.4  when  
tested in accordance with AS 4586.  
(4) Landings , where the edge leads to the flight  below, must have—  
a surface with a slip-resistance classification not less than that listed in Table 11.2.4  when tested in accordance  (a)
with AS 4586, for not less than 190 mm from the stair nosing; or  
a nosing strip with a slip-resistance classification not less than that listed in Table 11.2.4  when tested in  (b)
accordance with AS 4586.

 (1 May 2023)
Safe movement and access
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 297Explanatory Information  
To determine the appropriate surface of a tread or the floor surface of a ramp, it is necessary to determine the likely  •
conditions the tread or ramp will be subject to over the life of the building. This can be either dry, wet or both. A dry  
surface is one that is not normally wet or likely to be made wet other than by an accidental spill. A wet surface is  
one that is normally wet or likely to be made wet, including areas exposed to the weather.  
Under 11.2.4(2) stair treads must have a surface or nosing strip which minimises the risk of people slipping and  •
injuring themselves. In each case the surface or nosing must have a slip-resistance classification when tested in  
accordance with AS 4586. There are two tests (the Wet Pendulum Test or the Oil-Wet Inclining Platform Test) and  
two conditions (dry or wet) to be considered.  
Under 11.2.4(3) the floor surface of a ramp must be slip-resistant to minimise the risk of people slipping and injuring  •
themselves. The surface must have a slip-resistance classification when tested in accordance with AS 4586.  
 
 11.2.5   Landings 
[2019: 3.9.1.5]  
(1) Landings  must—  
be not less than 750 mm long and where this involves a change in direction, the length is measured 500 mm  (a)
from the inside edge of the landing  (see Figure 11.2.5a ); and  
have a gradient not steeper than 1:50; and  (b)
be provided where the sill of a threshold of a doorway opens onto a stairway or ramp that provides a change in  (c)
floor level or floor to ground level greater than 3 risers or 570 mm (see Figure 11.2.5b ); and  
extend across the full width of a doorway.  (d)
(2) In the case of a stairway serving only non- habitable rooms , such as attics, storerooms and the like that are not used  
on a regular or daily basis, the requirements of (1)(a) may be substituted with a minimum length of landing  being not  
less than 600 mm long.

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 298Explanatory Information : Purpose of a landing  
The purpose of a landing  is to provide a rest area for people using the stairway or ramp, and to allow the stairway or  
ramp to change direction if needed.  
 
Explanatory Information : Minimum landing length  
The minimum length of a landing  allows people using a stairway or ramp to rest, and reduces the risk of people falling  
more than one flight  of stairs.  
 
Explanatory Information : Maximum grade of 1:50 
The maximum grade of 1 in 50 required  under 11.2.5(1)(b) makes sure that the landing  is as level as possible, but still  
allows a slight slope for drainage if necessary.  
 
 11.2.6   Thresholds  
[2019: 3.9.1.6]

 11.3.1   Application  
[2019: 3.9.2.1]  
Compliance with this Part is achieved by complying with—  
11.3.3 , 11.3.4  and 11.3.6  for barriers to prevent falls; and  (a)
11.3.5  for handrails; and  (b)
11.3.7  and 11.3.8  for protection of openable windows.  (c)
 
Explanatory Information : External trafficable structures  
For a required  barrier to an external trafficable structure in an alpine area , the requirements of this Part need to be read  
in conjunction with the requirements of Part 12.2 . 
 
Explanatory Information : Swimming pools 
Safety barrier requirements for swimming pools  are contained in H7D2.  
 
Explanatory Information : Additional requirements  
In addition to the requirements of this Part, a barrier and handrail must comply with the structural requirements of Part 
2.2. The structural requirements refer to the barrier and/or handrail being designed and constructed to withstand any  
combinations of loads and other actions to which it may reasonably be subjected and the structural resistance of the  
materials and forms of construction used for the barrier or handrail.  
A window forming a part of a barrier must comply with the glazing assembly provisions of Section 8, and therefore is  
not required  to comply with AS/NZS 1170.1 (structural design actions - referenced in Part 2.2 ) as it is exempted by  
Section 8. The Section 8 provisions consider the wind loading on the glazing and human impact requirements.

 11.3.3   Barriers to prevent falls  
[2019: 3.9.2.2]  
(1) A continuous barrier must be provided along the side of a trafficable surface, such as—  
a stairway, ramp or the like; and  (a)
a floor, corridor, hallway, balcony, deck, verandah, mezzanine , access bridge or the like; and  (b)
a roof top space or the like to which general access is provided; and  (c)

where it is possible to fall 1 m or more measured from the level of the trafficable surface to the surface beneath (see  
Figure 11.3.3a ). 
(2) The requirements of (1) do not apply to—  
a retaining wall unless the retaining wall forms part of, or is directly associated with, a delineated path of access  (a)
to a building from the road, or a delineated path of access between buildings (see Figure 11.3.3b ); or

Explanatory Information : Intent 
The intent of the barrier requirements is to prescribe provisions to minimise the risk of a person falling from a stairway,  
raised floor level (such as a balcony) or the like. 11.3.3 sets out when barriers are required  to be provided and 11.3.4  
contains the requirements for the construction of barriers.  
 
Explanatory Information : Barriers and children  
Children are at particular risk of falling off, over or through ineffectively designed or constructed barriers. Accordingly  
the requirements of this Part aim to ensure that a barrier reduces the likelihood of children being able to climb over a  
barrier or fall through a barrier.  
 
 11.3.4   Construction of barriers to prevent falls  
[2019: 3.9.2.3]  
(1) A barrier required  by 11.3.3  must comply with (2) to (11).  
(2) The height of a barrier must be in accordance with the following:  
The height must not be less than 865 mm above the nosings of the stair treads, the floor of a ramp or the like  (a)
(see Figure 11.3.4a ). 
The height must not be less than—  (b)
1 m above the floor of any landing , corridor, hallway, balcony, deck, verandah, access path, mezzanine , (i)
access bridge, roof top space or the like to which general access is provided (see Figure 11.3.3b  and Figure  
11.3.4a ); or 
865 mm above the floor of a landing  to a stairway or ramp where the barrier is provided along the inside  (ii)

to 1 m at the landing  (see Figure 11.3.4b ). 
(4) Openings in barriers (including decorative balustrades) must be constructed so that they do not permit a 125 mm  
sphere to pass through it and for stairways, the opening is measured above the nosing line of the stair treads (see  
Figure 11.3.4a ). 
(5) Where a required  barrier is fixed to the vertical face forming an edge of a landing , balcony, deck, stairway or the like,  
the opening formed between the barrier and the face must not exceed 40 mm.  
(6) For the purposes of (5), the opening is measured horizontally from the edge of the trafficable surface to the nearest  
internal face of the barrier.  
(7) A barrier to a stairway serving a non- habitable room , such as an attic, storeroom or the like that is not used on a  
regular or daily basis, need not comply with (4) if—  
openings are constructed so that they do not permit a 300 mm sphere to pass through; or  (a)
where rails are used, the barrier consists of a top rail and an intermediate rail, with the openings between rails  (b)
not more than 460 mm. 
(8) Restriction on horizontal elements:  
Where it is possible to fall more than 4 m, any horizontal elements within the barrier between 150 mm and 760  (a)
mm above the floor must not facilitate climbing.  
For the purpose of (a), the 4 m is measured from the floor level of the trafficable surface to the surface beneath.  (b)
(9) A barrier constructed of wire is deemed to meet the requirements of (4) if it is constructed in accordance with 11.3.6 . 
(10) A glass barrier or window  serving as a barrier must comply with H1D8 and the relevant provisions of this Part.  
(11) A barrier, except a window  serving as a barrier, must be designed to take loading forces in accordance with AS/NZS

Explanatory Information  
For a window  forming part of a barrier, any horizontal elements such as a window  sill, transom or rail between 150 mm  
and 760 mm above the floor is deemed to facilitate climbing.  
Section 8 contains the glazing assembly provisions for glass barriers and windows  forming part of the barrier, however,  
the barrier would still need to comply with the relevant requirements of this Part for required  height, allowable openings,  
etc. 
 
 11.3.5   Handrails  
[2019: 3.9.2.4]  
(1) Handrails to a stairway or ramp must—  
be located along at least one side of the stairway flight  or ramp; and  (a)
be located along the full length of the stairway flight  or ramp, except in the case where a handrail is associated  (b)
with a barrier the handrail may terminate where the barrier terminates; and  
have the top surface of the handrail not less than 865 mm vertically above the nosings of the stair treads or the  (c)
floor surface of the ramp (see Figure 11.3.4b ); and  
be continuous and have no obstruction on or above them that will tend to break a handhold, except for newel  (d)
posts, ball type stanchions, or the like.  
(2) The requirements of (1) do not apply to—  
a stairway or ramp providing a change in elevation of less than 1 m; or  (a)
a landing ; or (b)
a winder  where a newel post is installed to provide a handhold.  (c)
 
Explanatory Information  
11.3.5 addresses requirements regarding location, height and extent of handrails. Where a barrier and handrail are  (1)
installed together, 11.3.5 is to be read in conjunction with 11.3.3 , 11.3.4  and 11.3.6 . 
A handrail is required  on at least one side of the stairway flight  or ramp. The top rail of a barrier may be suitable as  (2)
a handrail if it meets 11.3.5 and is able to be grasped by hand to provide support to the person using the stairway  
or ramp.

where the handrail is associated with the barrier, in which case the handrail can terminate where the barrier is 
allowed to terminate. This allows for the barriers to geometric stairways such as elliptical, spiral, circular or curved  
stairways to finish a few treads from the bottom of the stairway. 
11.3.5(1)(c) requires a minimum handrail height of 865 mm. This height provides comfort, stability, support and  (4)
assistance for most users. 
11.3.5(2) outlines where a handrail need not be provided, this includes—  (5)
where a stairway or ramp is providing a change in elevation less than 1 m; or  (a)
a landing  for a stairway or ramp; or  (b)
a winder  in a stairway if a newel post is installed to provide a handhold.  (c)
 
 11.3.6   Construction of wire barriers  
[2019: 3.9.2.5]  
(1) A wire barrier is deemed to meet the requirements of 11.3.4(4)  if it is constructed in accordance with (2) to (4).  
(2) For a horizontal or near horizontal wire system—  
when measured with a strain indicator, it must be in accordance with the tension values in Table 11.3.6a ; or (a)
when measured for a maximum permissible deflection, it must not exceed the maximum deflections in Table  (b)
11.3.6b . 
(3) For a non-continuous vertical wire system—  
when measured with a strain indicator, it must be in accordance with the tension values in Table 11.3.6a  (see  (a)
Note 4); or 
when measured for maximum permissible deflection, it must not exceed the maximum deflections in Table  (b)
11.3.6b . 
(4) For a continuous vertical or continuous near vertical sloped wire system—  
it must have wires of not more than 2.5 mm diameter with a lay of 7 x 7 or 7 x 19 construction; and  (a)
changes in direction at support rails must pass around a pulley block without causing permanent deformation to  (b)
the wire; and  
supporting rails must be spaced of not more than 900 mm apart and be of a material that does not allow deflection  (c)

Explanatory Information  
For the purpose of 11.3.6, a wire barrier consists of a series of tensioned wire rope connected to either vertical or  •
horizontal supports serving as a guard to reduce the risk of a person falling from a roof, stairway, raised floor level  
or the like. 
To assist in the application of 11.3.6, the following terms are explained:  •
Continuous - where the wire spans three or more supports.  (i)
Non-continuous - where the wire only spans between two supports.  (ii)
Pulley block - a device consisting of a wheel in which a wire runs around to change its direction.  (iii)
Permissible deflection - is the allowable bending of the wire.  (iv)
Support rails - are horizontal components of the barrier system that span across the top and bottom to provide  (v)
structural support. 
Tables 11.3.6a  and 11.3.6c  contain tension requirements for wires in vertical and horizontal wire barrier systems  •
with varying post spacings, wire spacings and wire types, whereas Table 11.3.6b  contains deflection requirements  
for use in horizontal and vertical barrier systems. The figures contained in the tables were derived from testing the  
spacing combinations in order to prevent the passage of a 125 mm diameter solid cone penetrating between the  
wires at a predetermined force.  
It is important to read the notes to the tables as they provide additional information on their application to horizontal,  •
vertical and near vertical wire barriers.  
Wire barriers deflect under loading conditions, even when tightly tensioned. This is particularly relevant over the  •
service life of the barrier as the wire tends to lose its tension. Therefore, care needs to be taken to ensure that wire  
tension will be maintained during the life of the barrier. In some situations, it may be necessary to incorporate “lock-
off” devices to prevent loosening of the wire. Likewise, if a threaded anchor bears against a soft wood post or rail,  
the anchor may indent the post or rail, thus loosening the wire.  
Temperature effects on the tension of the wire may be significant but there is little that can be done to allow for  •
temperature variation in service. The shorter the wire span, the lesser the effect will be.  
Stainless steel wire with a lay of 1 x 19 has the greatest elastic modulus and will take up the same load with less  •Wire dia. (mm) Lay Wire spacing (mm) Required tension in

Explanatory Information : Intent 
The intent of 11.3.7 is to reduce the risk of a person (especially a young child) falling through an openable window.  
 
Explanatory Information : Protection of openable windows – bedrooms 
Where the floor level below an openable window in a bedroom is less than 2 m there are no specific requirements. For  
an openable window 2 m or more above the surface beneath, openable windows are required  to restrict passage of a  
125 mm sphere using any one of the following design solutions:  
The window be designed such that any opening does not allow a 125 mm sphere to pass through (e.g. louvres)  •
and be capable of resisting a 250 N force when directed against the window.  
The window be fitted with a fixed or dynamic device that is capable of restricting the window opening so it does not  •
allow a 125 mm sphere to pass through and is difficult for a young child to operate. The restricting device must be  
capable of resisting a 250 N force when directed against the window such as a casement window or in attempting  
to push a sliding window open. An internal screen with similar parameters may be installed.  
The window be fitted with an internal or external screen that does not allow a 125 mm sphere to pass through and  •
which must resist a horizontal outward force of 250 N.  
If the openable part of the window is at least 1.7 m above the floor, no further protection is required . 
 
Explanatory Information : Restricting devices 
Where a device or screen is securely fixed in position (e.g. a screen pop riveted to the window frame) so it cannot be  
unlocked, overridden, or is very difficult to remove without for example a drill, the 865 mm barrier would not be required  
as the securing method is considered a fixture and not a child resistant release mechanism. 11.3.7(2)(b)(iii) relates to  
a screen or window restricting device protecting an openable window in a bedroom. The screen or opening restricting  
device may be installed in a manner that allows it to be removed, unlocked or overridden in the event of a fire or other  
emergency to allow safe egress. In these situations the unlocking device must be child resistant.  
Child resistance could be achieved by the need to use a tool, key or two hands.  
There are a number of hardware options available. Short chain winders and barrier screens will allow windows to comply  
with this requirement. Sliding window locks may lock a sash so a 125 mm sphere cannot pass through. Where provision  
is made to fully open the window beyond 125 mm then the child resistant release mechanism is required in addition to  
the device resisting a 250 N force as required  by 11.3.7(2)(b)(ii).  
11.3.7 in addition prescribes that an 865 mm barrier (sill) would be required . A wall beneath an openable window or  
fixed glazing under the openable part of a window which meets the height requirements (e.g. transom at least 865 mm  
above the floor) can be considered as the barrier if the criteria in 11.3.7 are met.

The term “window” is not italicised in 11.3.7 and as such, is not restricted to the definition of “window” in the NCC. The  
reason for this is to also capture windows that may let in air but not light, e.g. metal louvres. A metal louvre or openable  
panel would not fit in the NCC definition of window but is subject to the window barrier provisions.

reason for this is to also capture windows that may let in air but not light, e.g. metal louvres. A metal louvre or openable  
panel would not fit in the NCC definition of window but is subject to the window barrier provisions.  11.3.8

 12.2.1   Application  
[New for 2022]  
Part 12.2  applies subject to the provisions at H7D3(2) and (3).  
 
Explanatory Information  
Buildings constructed in alpine areas  need special consideration because of sub-zero temperatures which can create  
elements which restrict free movement to and from the building. The additional measures in this Part include—  
having external doorways open in a way that is not impeded by snow and ice outside; and  •
for external trafficable structures forming part of the means of egress, being constructed so that they remain useable  •
under snow conditions, and  
minimising the impact of snow build up between and around buildings.  •
Part 2.2  (structural provisions) and Section 13 (energy efficiency) also contain specific additional requirements for a  
building located in an alpine area . 
 
 12.2.2   External doors  
[2019: 3.10.4.2]  
External doors that may be subject to a build-up of snow must—  
open inwards or slide; and  (a)
be constructed so that the threshold is not less than 900 mm above the adjoining surface; and  (b)
in a Class 1b building, be marked “OPEN INWARDS” on the inside face of the door in letters not less than 75  (c)
mm high and in a colour contrasting with that of the background.  
 12.2.3   External trafficable structures  
[2019: 3.10.4.3]  
External stairways, ramps, access bridges or other trafficable structures serving the building must have—  
a floor surface that consists of expanded mesh if it is used as a means of egress; and  (a)
any required  barrier designed so that its sides are not less than 75% open; and  (b)
for a stairway, goings  (G), risers  (R) and slope relationship quantity (2R + G) in accordance with—  (c)
Table 11.2.2a ; or (i)

[2019: 3.10.4.4]]  
A building must be constructed so that—  
for any external walls  more than 3.6 m above the natural ground level, the distance of that part of the building  (a)
from the allotment boundary (other than a road alignment) must be not less than 2.5 m plus an additional 100  
mm for each 300 mm or part by which that part of the external wall  exceeds a height of 3.6 m (see Figure  
12.2.4a ); and  
if an external doorway discharges into a court between wings of a building and that area may be used for vehicle  (b)
access to the building, the clear distance between wings must be not less than 4 m (see Figure 12.2.4b ); and  
where an external doorway discharges opposite a feature that could trap snow or an embankment that is more  (c)
than 900 mm above the threshold of that doorway, a minimum clear distance of not less than 4 m must be  
provided between the door and the feature (see Figure 12.2.4c  and Figure 12.2.4d ).

Explanatory Information : Snow build -up around buildings 
The design and construction of a building in an alpine area  must not aid dangerous levels of snow build-up between  
and around buildings. This control—  
assists with egress in an emergency; and  •
helps vehicle access around the buildings, both for snow clearing and emergency situations; and  •
minimises the risk of snow or ice falling from the roof onto adjoining lots or egress routes.  •
 
Explanatory Information : Set -back distances 
12.2.4(a) prescribes set-back requirements for external walls  from the boundary of adjoining allotments. The aim is to  
ensure that a reasonable distance is created between buildings to reduce the amount of snow build-up between  
properties. 12.2.4(a) applies only to the area adjacent to that part of the wall that is more than 3.6 m in height.  
 
Explanatory Information : Distance between wings of buildings 
12.2.4(b) prescribes a minimum distance between wings of a building or attached buildings where external doorways  
may discharge into this area. This requirement only applies where the court or wings are able to be accessed by vehicles.  
 
Explanatory Information : Embankments adjoining buildings

[New for 2022]  
Part 12.3  applies subject to the limitations set out at H1D11.  
 12.3.2   Fixing decks and balconies to external walls  
[2019: 3.10.6.2]  
Where a deck or balcony relies on the external wall  of a building or structure for support, the method of attachment,  
including any fixings, to the external wall  must comply with the following:  
The deck or balcony’s joist framing members must be supported at the wall by a waling plate.  (a)
The joist span nearest the external wall  must not be more than 3 m (single or continuous span).  (b)
The size of a waling plate required  by (a) must be not less than—  (c)
for a timber waling plate—  (i)
140 x 35 mm with a minimum stress grade of F5 or MGP10 when fixed to concrete core-filled masonry (A)

Explanatory Information  
When using fixings specified in 12.3.2(d), care must be taken if chemical anchors are selected. The use of chemical  
anchors in horizontal applications is limited. Attention should be paid to selecting only chemical anchors that are  
specifically designed and manufactured for use in horizontal or overhead applications.  
Consideration needs to be given to offsetting the waling plate fastener spacing to avoid interference with joist attachment.  
To ensure fasteners are positively anchored to the building or structure they need to be located so that they are not  
fixed into mortar beds between masonry units or fixed into blocking or the end grains of timbers.  
An I-beam is not considered a solid joist or bearer framing member under 12.3.2(d)(ii) and is therefore not permitted as  
an appropriate method of support for attachment of a deck or balcony to an external wall . 
The working load capacity of an anchor required  by 12.3.2(e)(iii)(A) may be available in technical data provided by the  
manufacturer of the anchor.  
The bolt category 4.6/S refers to a commercial bolt of a strength grade of 4.6 using a snug tight method of tensioning.  
AS 4100 contains information on tensioning techniques and the methods of determining the strength of an anchor.  
Where the waling plate is fixed to the external wall  through wall cladding, fixing length must be increased to compensate  
for the additional width of the cladding to ensure the connection to the external wall  is structurally adequate.  
All coach screwed joints should be pre-drilled with a pilot hole whose diameter is not greater than that of the threaded  
portion of the screw. 
 
 12.3.3   Flashings to the junction of the waling plate and external wall  
[2019: 3.10.6.3]  
Where the wall cladding is removed to attach a waling plate, openings in external wall  cladding exposed to the weather  
must be flashed with materials complying with AS/NZS 2904 and in accordance with the following:  Core-filled reinforced
masonry external wall
Staggered M12 anchors

Ancillary provisions
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 320Flashings  must be provided to bottom, tops and the sides of the junction of the waling plate and the external  (a)
wall, and must be installed so that the flashing — 
extends not less than 150 mm beyond each side of the waling plate where practicable; and  (i)
is attached to the waling plate and wall framing; and  (ii)
at the top and bottom of the waling plate, drains to the outside face of the wall or cladding.  (iii)
Joins in the flashing  must—  (b)
overlap by not less than 75 mm in the direction of flow; and  (i)
be securely fastened at intervals of not more than 40 mm; and  (ii)
have sealant installed between laps.  (iii)
The method of flashing  must be suitable for the framing and cladding used.  (c)
Flashings  must be securely fixed at least 25 mm under the cladding at ends and edges of the framing of the  (d)
opening.  
 
Explanatory Information  
Consideration needs to be given to the method of fixing the waling plate to the external wall  so that deterioration of the  
external wall  as a result of water entry will not occur. Such cases would include where the wall cladding is removed to  
attach a waling plate. This may be achieved by installing flashing  between the external wall  and the waling plate.  
 
 12.3.4   Bracing 
[2019: 3.10.6.4]  
Where a deck or balcony is more than 1 m off the ground when measured from the uppermost surface of the deck or  
balcony at any point to the top of any supporting footing, bracing must be installed as follows:  
Two diagonally opposed 30 x 0.8 mm galvanized steel straps must be installed across the top or underside of  (a)
the joists and be attached using one fixing at—  
each joist or equivalent framing member; and  (i)
the waling plate.  (ii)
A secondary set of 30 x 0.8 mm steel straps must be installed using one fixing at each joist or equivalent framing  (b)
member in accordance with Figure 12.3.4  where the deck or balcony extends more than 4 m from the external  
wall. 
The steel straps must— (c)
be continuous and extend diagonally at an angle between 30° to 60°; and  (i)
span not more than 4 m when measured along a line at a right angle from the external wall . (ii)
Fixings for the steel straps must be— (d)
for timber framing, 50 x 3.15 hot-dipped galvanized flat head ring shank or flat head deformed nail; or  (i)
for steel framing, 8-18 self embedding head or wafer head screws.  (ii)Where the deck or balcony is located within a severe corrosion environment, the bracing and fixings must comply  (e)

 13.2.1   Application of Part 13.2  
[2019: 3.12.1]  
(1) The provisions of 13.2.2  to 13.2.6  apply to—  
a Class 1 building; and  (a)
a Class 10a building with a conditioned space . (b)
(2) The provisions of 13.2.7  apply to a Class 1 building with an attached Class 10a building.  
(3) Part 13.2  must be applied as directed in H6D2(1)(a) or (b).  
 13.2.2   Building fabric thermal insulation  
[2019: 3.12.1.1]  
(1) Where required , insulation must comply with AS/NZS 4859.1 and be installed so that it—  
abuts or overlaps adjoining insulation other than at supporting members such as columns, studs, noggings,  (a)
joists, furring channels and the like where the insulation must butt against the member; and  
forms a continuous barrier with ceilings, walls, bulkheads, floors or the like that inherently contribute to the  (b)
thermal barrier; and  
does not affect the safe or effective operation of a domestic service  or fitting.  (c)
(2) Where required , reflective insulation  must be installed with—  
the necessary airspace, to achieve the required R-Value  between a reflective side of the reflective insulation  (a)
and a building lining or cladding; and  
the reflective insulation  closely fitted against any penetration, door or window  opening; and  (b)
the reflective insulation  adequately supported by framing members; and  (c)
each adjoining sheet of roll membrane being—  (d)
overlapped greater than or equal to 150 mm; or  (i)
taped together. (ii)
(3) Where required , bulk insulation must be installed so that—  
it maintains its position and thickness, other than where it crosses roof battens, water pipes, electrical cabling  (a)
or the like; and  
in a ceiling, where there is no bulk insulation or reflective insulation  in the external wall  beneath, it overlaps the  (b)
external wall  by greater than or equal to 50 mm.  
 
Explanatory Information : Example  
In a two storey house with the second storey set back, the insulation in the first storey wall, the second storey wall  •
and the roof over the set-back must be continuous. Therefore if the roof over the set-back has insulation on a 
horizontal ceiling, then insulation is also needed on the vertical in any ceiling space in order to connect the ceiling  
insulation to the second storey wall.  
To form a continuous barrier, insulation should be placed in gaps between window and door jambs, heads and sills,  •
and the adjoining wall framing unless a gap is otherwise required . This may need to be compressible to allow for  
movement between members.  Part 13.2 Building fabric
 (1 May 2023)
Energy efficiency
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 332 
Explanatory Information : Safety of domestic services 
Care should be taken when installing insulation to ensure that it does not interfere with the safety or performance of  
domestic services  and fittings such as heating flues, recessed light fittings, light transformers, gas appliances and  
general plumbing and electrical components. This includes providing appropriate clearance as detailed in relevant  
legislation and referenced standards such as for electrical, gas and fuel oil installations.  
 
Explanatory Information : Compression of insulation  
The R-Value  of insulation, including insulation used to mitigate thermal bridging, is reduced if it is compressed. The  
allocated space for insulation must therefore allow the insulation to be installed so that it maintains its correct thickness  
to achieve the product’s stated R-Value . Otherwise the R-Value  needs to be reduced to account for any compression.  
This is particularly relevant to wall and cathedral ceiling framing whose members can only accommodate a limited  
thickness of insulation. In some instances, larger framing members or thinner insulation material, such as rigid boards,  
may be necessary to ensure that the insulation achieves its required  R-Value . 
 
Explanatory Information : Installation of reflective insulation  
For reflective insulation  and the adjoining airspace to achieve its tested R-Value , the airspace needs to be a certain  
width. This width varies depending on the particular type of reflective insulation . The R-Value  also depends on the  
orientation of the insulation.  
Where reflective insulation  also acts as a vapour barrier or sarking, both a minimum overlap and taping may be  
necessary. 
 
 
NSW 13.2.3  
 13.2.3   Roofs and ceilings  
[2019: 3.12.1.2]  
(1) Roof and ceiling insulation must achieve the minimum R-Value —

Explanatory Information : Table 13.2.3w 
When considering the reduction of insulation because of exhaust fans, flues or recessed downlights, 0.5% of the  •
ceiling area for a 200 m2 house would permit 2 bathroom heater-light assemblies, a laundry exhaust fan, a kitchen  
exhaust fan and either approximately 20 recessed down-lights with 50 mm clearance to insulation, 10 recessed  
downlights with 100 mm clearance to insulation or only 3 recessed downlights with 200 mm clearance to insulation.  
Note that 13.2.3(5) does not require an increase in ceiling insulation for roof lights . •
Placing some of the required  insulation at the roof level may result in a more practical outcome. Insulation at the  •
roof level is effective in warm climates and significantly moderates the roof space extremes and condensation  risk 
in cold climates. Note that Part 10.8  contains specific provisions for condensation . 
 
Explanatory Information : Thermal bridging calculation methods  
The effect of thermal bridging through repeating framing elements such as ceiling joists and the bottom chord of ceiling  
trusses must be considered when calculating the Total R-Value  of metal-framed roofs. Other types of thermal bridges  
may be calculated if considered significant.

The roof light  shaft index is determined by measuring the distance from the centre of the shaft at the roof to the  (1)
centre of the shaft at the ceiling level and dividing it by the average internal dimension of the shaft opening at the  
ceiling level (or the diameter for a circular shaft) in the same units of measurement.  
The area of a roof light  is the area of the roof opening that allows light to enter the building. The total area of roof (2)
lights  is the combined area for all roof lights  serving the room or space.

Explanatory Information  
A lightweight wall has no high thermal mass cladding on the outside or lining on the inside. Typically, this would  •
represent a framed wall, clad externally with timber weatherboards, fibre-cement sheet, metal or autoclaved aerated  
concrete. 
Because of the high thermal conductance of metal, a thermal break is needed when a metal framing member directly  •
connects the external cladding to the internal lining or the internal environment. For the purposes of 13.2.5(5)(b),  
expanded polystyrene strips greater than or equal to 12 mm thickness and timber greater than or equal to 20 mm  
thickness are deemed to achieve an R-Value  greater than or equal to 0.2.  
Continuous insulation placed outside the primary insulation layer , including reflective insulation , may also be subject  •
to vapour permeance  requirements of 10.8.1(2) . Many continuous insulation products and foils have a low vapour  
permeance. Some reflective insulation  products have perforations to increase their vapour permeance . Many  
perforated reflective insulation  products are not classified as a water barrier by AS 4200.1. Accordingly, these  
products are not suitable for use as a water control layer . 
Many reflective insulation  products that use perforations to increase their vapour permeance  are not suitable for  •
use behind vertical or diagonally orientated timber cladding boards, where required  by clause 7.5.2  of the ABCB  
Housing Provisions, or behind open jointed or unsealed cladding systems.

Explanatory Information  
For 13.2.6(3) the effect of thermal bridging through repeating framing elements must be considered when calculating  •
the Total R-Value  of metal-framed floors. Other types of thermal bridges may be calculated if considered significant.  
13.2.6(7) provides an exemption for an in-screed heating or cooling system used solely in bathrooms, amenity •
areas and the like, as these are typically small areas.  
Care should be taken to ensure that the type of termite management system selected is compatible with the slab  •
edge insulation.

Figure Notes  
The orientation sector for a wall or glazing  element is the sector that contains a line drawn perpendicular to the  (1)
face of the wall or glazing  element.  
This Figure is based on True North and all angles are measured clockwise from True North. Survey angles on site  (2)
plans are usually marked in angles from True North. These angles can be used to establish True North for a  
particular site.  
Magnetic North, found by a magnetic compass, varies from True North over time and by different amounts in  (3)
different locations. Magnetic North is not an acceptable approximation of True North.  
The eight orientation sectors shown in this Figure do not overlap at their boundaries. For example, north sector  (4)
begins just clockwise after the NNW line and ends exactly on the NNE line. The start and end of other sectors are  
determined in a similar way, as indicated by the other curved arrows.  NORTH SECTOR

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 385Explanatory Information  
There is little or no need for heating at any time of the year in climate zone  1. Therefore, this clause does not apply •
in climate zone  1.
For the bedroom conductance factor (BC), the conductance heat loss from windows  in bedrooms and unconditioned •
areas has less impact on the heating loads of a dwelling than conductance heat loss from windows  in a living area
due to the dif
ferent time of day that the rooms are occupied. Bedrooms are typically not occupied during the day
when outdoor temperatures and solar heat gains are higher
.
For the orientation sector conductance factor (OC) in a room which has higher solar heat gain through the glazing , •
the average temperature in the room will be higher than an orientation which has lower solar heat gain through the
glazing .
 13.3.3   External glazing — summer  
[New for 2022]  
(1) In climate zones  1 to 7, the aggregate solar heat gain of the glazing  in each storey  of a building, including any
mezzanine , must—
not exceed the allowance resulting from multiplying the floor area  of each storey , measured within the enclosing (a)
walls, by the constant CSHGC obtained from Table 13.3.3a ; and

 Table 13.3.3a: Constant for solar heat gain coefficient (CSHGC): climate zones 1 to 7
Table Notes 
The ventilation opening  area is the total area of each ventilation opening  divided by the floor area  of the storey, including any mezzanine . (1)
No window  may have a design ventilation opening  greater than 90% because the window frame will always obstruct some of the area of the opening. (2)
Where the ventilation opening  area is more than 20%, the CSHGC value corresponding to 20% ventilation opening area is to be used. (3)
Where the floor construction of a storey, including any mezzanine , is partly in direct contact with the ground and partly suspended, the constant is to be— (4)
interpolated between the constants in proportion to the floor area  of each floor type; or (a)
the constant for a suspended floor.(b)
If the ventilation opening  area is between the values shown in this Table, the constant may be interpolated. (5)Floor type Ventilation

Where a factor is listed as ‘Not applicable’, the value of the factor must be taken as 1.0.  
Explanatory Information  
There is little or no need for cooling at any time of the year in climate zone  8. Therefore, this clause does not apply •
in climate zone  8.
By referring to ‘ glazing  elements’, 13.3.3  require Total System U-Values  and Total System SHGCs  to be assessed •
for the combined effect of glass and frames. The measurement of these Total System U-Values  and Total System
SHGCs  is specified in the Technical Protocols and Procedures Manual for Energy Rating of Fenestration by the
Australian Fenestration Rating Council (AFRC) for glazing  elements of representative size and arrangements.
V
arious assessors using AFRC procedures might refer to their published performance values by slightly different •
terms including ‘U Factor’ or ‘Uw’ for Total System U-Value  or ‘SHGC’ for Total System SHGC . Such values can be
used under 13.3.3 provided they measure the combined glass and frame performance according to 
AFRC
requirements.
For the room factor
, the solar heat gains to bedrooms and unconditioned areas have less impact on the cooling •
loads of dwellings than solar heat gains to a living area due to the different time of day that the rooms are occupied.
Bedrooms are typically not occupied during the day when outdoor temperatures and solar heat gains are higher
.
For the frame factor
, the darker the window frame, the greater the solar heat gain through the frame. Radiation •
gains from windows  are multiplied by this factor.
For the floor factor
, this is only applied for dwellings with a floor in contact with the ground. If a room has a tiled •
surface or is a polished slab, radiation gains in this room are multiplied by this factor.
 13.3.4   Shading 
[2019: 3.12.2.2]  
Where shading is required  to comply with 13.3.2  or 13.3.3 , it must—  
be provided by an external permanent projection, such as a verandah, balcony, fixed canopy, eaves, shading (a)
hood or carport, which—
extends horizontally on both sides of the glazing  for a distance greater than or equal to the projection (i)
distance P
 in Figure 13.3.2b ; or
provide the equivalent shading to (i) with a reveal or the like; or (ii)
be provided by an external shading device, such as a shutter
, blind, vertical or horizontal building screen with (b)
blades, battens or slats, which—
is capable of restricting at least 80% of the summer solar radiation; and (i)
if adjustable, is readily operated either manually
, mechanically or electronically by the building occupants. (ii)
Explanatory Information  
Shading devices can include fixed louvres, shading screens and other types of perforated or fixed angle slatted•
shades. However, such devices need to be designed for the climate and latitude to ensure that summer sun
penetration is restricted, while winter sun access is achieved. Winter access refers to the availability of winter solar
gains to of
fset conducted heat losses.
The impact of shading is assessed with respect to the solar heat gain of the glazing . The requirements of 13.3.2 •
and 13.3.3  consider solar heat gain to be either beneficial or detrimental to the energy efficiency of a building based
on seasonal variation (winter/summer), climate zone , orientation and P/H. Higher P/H values are more beneficial
in minimising summer solar heat gain where as lower P/H values are more beneficial in allowing winter access.
Gutters can only be considered as providing shading if attached to a shading projection such as a verandah, fixed•Type of factor Factor for a floor in direct contact with

Shading devices can be either attached or located adjacent to the building. For example, a free-standing lattice  •
screen may be considered to provide shading to glazing  if it complies with 13.3.4(b).  
An adjustable shading device in 13.3.4(b)(ii) should be readily operated from a safe location or platform that does  •
not require ladders, rigging, harnessing, or the like.  13.3.4

NSW 13.4.1 
 13.4.1   Application of Part 13.4  
[2019: 3.12.3]  
(1) This Part applies to—
a Class 1 building; and (a)
a Class 10a building with a conditioned space . (b)
(2) The provisions of (1) do not apply to the following:
A
 building in climate zones  1, 2, 3 and 5 where the only means of air-conditioning is by using an evaporative (a)
cooler
.
A
 permanent building ventilation opening  that is necessary for the safe operation of a gas appliance. (b)
(3) Part 13.4  must be applied as directed in H6D2(1)(a) or (b).
Explanatory Information  
An evaporatively cooled building in climate zones  4 and 6 must be sealed because of the likelihood of the building •
being heated during colder periods.
Appropriate ventilation requirements for gas appliances can be obtained from relevant legislation, referenced•
standards and product installation manuals.
 13.4.2   Chimneys and flues  
[2019: 3.12.3.1]  
The chimney or flue of an open solid-fuel burning appliance must be provided with a damper or flap that can be closed to  
seal the chimney or flue.  
Explanatory Information  
The requirements of this Part are to be read in conjunction with the fire safety requirements in Part 12.4  of the •
ABCB Housing Provisions.
A
 solid-fuel burning appliance is a heater that burns materials such as timber, coal and the like. This clause does •
not apply to gas and liquid fuel burning appliances.
 13.4.3   Roof lights 
[2019: 3.12.3.2]  
(1) A roof light  must be sealed, or capable of being sealed, when serving—
a conditioned space ; or (a)
a habitable room  in climate zones  4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. (b)
(2) A roof light  required  by (1) to be sealed, or capable of being sealed, must be constructed with—
an imperforate ceiling dif

Explanatory Information  
The insulation levels in Explanatory Table 13.7.3  are typical examples of materials that can be used to insulate •
central heating water piping  calculated in accordance with AS/NZS 4859.1.
The R-Value  is that of the insulation and not the Total R-Value  of the pipe, air film and insulation. Where piping  has •
a significant inherent R-Value  it may be subtracted from the material R-Value  required . However, the inherent R-
Value  of most piping is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 13.7.3.
Piping  within a timber member, such as that passing through a wall stud, is considered to have sufficient insulation •
for the purposes of 13.7.3.

(4) The material R-Value  required  by (1)(a) must be determined in accordance with the following:  
In a heating-only system or cooling-only system including an evaporative cooling system—  (a)
ductwork must have a minimum material R-Value  of—  (i)
in climate zones  1 to 7 — 1.0; and  (A)
in climate zone  8 — 1.5; and  (B)
fittings must have a minimum material R-Value  of 0.4.  (ii)
In a combined heating and refrigerated cooling system—  (b)
ductwork must have a minimum material R-Value  of—  (i)
in climate zones  1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 — 1.5; and  (A)
in climate zones  2 and 5 — 1.0; and  (B)
in climate zone  8 — 1.5; and  (C)
fittings must have a minimum material R-Value  of 0.4.  (ii)
For the purposes of (b)(i), the minimum material R-Value  required  for ductwork may be reduced by 0.5 for  (c)
combined heating and refrigerated cooling systems in climate zones  1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 if the ducts are—  
under a suspended floor with an enclosed perimeter; or  (i)
in a roof space that has an insulation of greater than or equal to R0.5 directly beneath the roofing.  (ii)
 
Explanatory Information  
Ductwork within a fully insulated building may still benefit from insulation particularly when the system is only  •
operating for short periods.  
In some climate zones  condensation may create problems with uninsulated ductwork, in which case insulation  •
should still be considered.  
An enclosed perimeter treatment means that the airspace under the floor is enclosed between ground and floor  •
level by walls which have only the required subfloor vents.  
Insulation for refrigerated cooling ductwork should have a vapour barrier to prevent possible damage by  •
condensation.  
The insulation levels in the Explanatory Tables 13.7.4a , 13.7.4b  and 13.7.4c  are typical examples of materials that  •
can be used to insulate ductwork and the R-Values  they contribute. Other methods are available for meeting the  
minimum material R-Value  required  by 13.7.4(4). These values do not take into account all issues that may reduce  
the effectiveness of insulation. AS/NZS 4859.1 should be used to confirm in-situ values.  
For fittings, 11 mm polyurethane typically provides an R-Value  of 0.4.  •
Any flexible ductwork used for the transfer of products, initiating from a heat source that contains a flame, must  •
also have the fire hazard properties required  by H3D2(2).

Explanatory Information  
There are two approaches available for achieving compliance with (1) in Class 1 and associated Class 10a buildings.•
These are through the determination of the lamp power density  or the illumination power density .
The first step in achieving compliance is to determine the relevant lamp power density  or illumination power density •
allowance. Generally, the lamp power density  or illumination power density  is the relevant value in (1)(a), (b) or (c),
however the illumination power density  allowance can be increased in accordance with (2) if a control device is
used.
When illumination power density  and one or more control devices are used, the adjustment factor is only applied •
to the space(s) served by the control device. The adjusted allowance for this space is then combined with the
allowances for the remaining spaces using an area weighted average, which subsequently increases the allowance
provided in (1)(a), (b) or (c).
Where no control device is used the adjustment factor is equal to 1.•
The second step in achieving compliance is to assess the overall lamp power density  or overall illumination power •
density  of the building.
The overall lamp power density  is calculated by adding the maximum power ratings of all of the permanently wired •
lamps in a space and dividing this sum by the area of the space.
The overall illumination power density  is calculated by adding the illumination power load for each space and dividing •
this sum by the area of the space.13.7 .6
 (1 May 2023)
Energy efficiency
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 411Control device factors in (2) are only applied to the illumination power density , not the overall illumination power  •
density . 
To comply with (1), the overall lamp power density  or overall illumination power density  must be less than or equal  •
to the allowance.  
Trading of allowances between (1)(a), (b) and (c) is not permitted.  •
(1)(b) includes outdoor living spaces such as verandahs, balconies, patios, alfresco spaces or the like that are •
attached to a Class 1 building.  
The artificial lighting requirements in 13.7.6 are to be read in conjunction with the artificial lighting requirements in  •
10.5.2 . 
The artificial lighting around the perimeter of a building does not need to comply to a maximum power density as  •
neither the lighting required or the area of the space can be easily defined. Instead, external lights are required to  
be controlled by daylight sensors or to be efficient.  
In (4), separate switching is required for halogen lamps to facilitate less frequent usage. This is because they are  •
significantly less energy efficient that fluorescent lamps.

Explanatory Information  
Resistance to the incipient spread of fire refers to the ability of a ceiling to prevent the spread of fire and thermally  
insulate the space between the ceiling and the roof or floor above. “Resistance to the incipient spread of fire” is superior  
to “fire-resistance” because it requires a higher standard of heat insulation.

 NSW 9.5.1   Smoke and heat alarm requirements  
[2019: NSW 3.7.5.2 and NSW 1.1.4]  
(1) Smoke alarms must— 
be located in—  (a)
Class 1a buildings excluding any non-associated Class 10a private garages , subject to (2), in accordance  (i)
with 9.5.2  and 9.5.4 ; and  
Class 1b buildings in accordance with 9.5.3  and 9.5.4 ; and  (ii)
comply with AS 3786, except that in a Class 10a private garage  where the use of the area is likely to result in  (b)
smoke alarms causing spurious signals, any other alarm deemed suitable in accordance with AS 1670.1 may  
be installed provided that smoke alarms complying AS 3786 are installed elsewhere in the Class 1 building; and  
be powered from the consumer mains source where a consumer mains source is supplied to the building; and  (c)
be interconnected where there is more than one alarm.  (d)
(2) Heat alarms must— 
be installed in a Class 10a private garage  that is located beneath a garage top dwelling  and not associated with  (a)
that dwelling; and  
be located on or near the ceiling; and  (b)
comply with AS 1603.3; and  (c)
be powered from the consumer mains source supplying the garage top dwelling  where a consumer mains source  (d)
is supplied to the building; and  
be interconnected to the garage top dwelling  smoke alarms required  by 9.5.2 . (e)
(3) Where heat alarms required  by (2) are installed, durable notices must be permanently fixed to the garage top dwelling  
and non-associated Class 10a private garage  in prominent locations, indicating that—  
a heat alarm is installed in the non-associated Class 10a private garage ; and  (a)
the heat alarm is interconnected to the garage top dwelling  smoke alarms.  (b)
 
Explanatory Information  
A smoke alarm can give spurious alarms if the atmosphere contains particles which obscure vision, such as could occur  
in a Class 10a private garage  part of a building. NSW 9.5.1(1)(b) therefore allows the use of a more suitable alarm,  
such as a heat alarm, in these locations.  
NSW 9.5.1(1)(d) requires alarms to be interconnected where there is more than one alarm. This only applies within a  
single dwelling. Therefore alarms in a Class 1a dwelling need not be interconnected with alarms in another dwelling.  
Where a Class 10a private garage  is located beneath a garage top dwelling  and is not associated with that dwelling,  
NSW 9.5.1(2)(a) requires a heat alarm to be provided in the non-associated Class 10a private garage . NSW 9.5.1(2)(b)  
to (e) contains requirements for installing heat alarms. NSW 9.5.1(3) contains requirements for the provision of durable  
notices. 9 Fire safety

(2) Where a garage top dwelling  is served by an internal stair, the garage top dwelling  must be separated from a non-
associated private garage  by a wall complying with NSW 9.4.3 .
(3) Where a garage top dwelling  is located above both associated and non-associated private garages —
in addition to a floor required  by (1), the private garages  must be separated with a wall complying with NSW (a)

an R-Value  of not less than R0.2, installed at all points of contact between the external cladding and the metal frame
if the wall—
does not have a wall lining or has a wall lining that is fixed directly to the metal frame; and (a)
is clad with weatherboards, fibre-cement or the like, or metal sheeting fixed to the metal frame. (b)
(2) The requirements of (1) do not apply to walls constructed using insulated sandwich panels.
Explanatory Information  
A lightweight wall has no high thermal mass cladding on the outside or lining on the inside. Typically, this would•
represent a framed wall, clad externally with timber weatherboards, fibre-cement sheet, metal or autoclaved aerated
concrete.
Because of the high thermal conductance of metal, a thermal break is needed when a metal framing member directly•
connects the external cladding to the internal lining or the internal environment. For the purposes of NSW
13.2.5(1)(b), expanded polystyrene strips greater than or equal to 12 mm thickness and timber greater than or13 Energy efficiency

perforated reflective insulation  products are not classified as a water barrier by AS 4200.1. Accordingly, these
products are not suitable for use as a water control layer .
Many reflective insulation  products that use perforations to increase their vapour permeance  are not suitable for •

Explanatory Information  
The term “cannot be fully enclosed” means parts of buildings with permanent openings such as balconies, shade  •
rooms, rooms with fixed louvres, mesh or other material that allows air flow. Adjustable louvres are considered to  
provide full enclosure to the opening they accommodate. Such rooms are unlikely to be conditioned given the high  
air flow rates; therefore application of the Performance Requirement  to these parts of buildings would not result in  
reduction in energy use.  
Appropriate ventilation for gas appliances can be obtained from relevant legislation, referenced standards and  •

Explanatory Information : 13.2.3(2 ) 
The roof space ventilation option applies to a pitched roof with a flat ceiling to ensure that efficient cross ventilation  •
is achieved in the roof space to remove hot air. Roof space ventilation is generally not suitable for most flat, skillion,  
cathedral ceiling and similar roof types because of the lack of space between the ceiling and roof.  
Care should be taken to ensure that the roof ventilation openings  do not allow rain penetration and that they comply  •
with appropriate bushfire provisions.  
Gaps between roof tiles with sarking (or reflective insulation  at rafter level) and metal sheet roofing are not  •
acceptable methods of providing roof space ventilation.  
Compliance with the ventilation provisions may result in the ingress of wind driven rain or fine dust, or stimulate the  •
growth of mould or fungus in the roof enclosure. Consideration should therefore be given to the surrounding  
environmental features prior to adopting this as an alternative to the roof insulation provisions.  
A light coloured roof reduces the flow of heat from solar radiation better than a dark colour roof. A roof with a solar  •
absorptance value of less than 0.55 means the roof is of a light colour such as white, off-white, cream or dull zinc  
aluminium.

ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 509Explanatory Information : Tables NT 13.2.3a, NT 13.2.3b and NT 13.2.3c  
Typical construction: The tables above provide examples of various roofs and ceiling, walls and floors. The Total R- •
Value  required  is achieved by adding the Total R-Value  of the basic element, i.e. roof and ceiling, walls or floors,
and the R-Value  of any additional insulation incorporated in that element The Total R-Value  of the basic roof and
ceiling has been determined by adding together the R-Values  of the outdoor air film, roof cladding, roof airspace,
ceiling sheet lining and internal film.
The Total R-Value  of the roof and ceiling materials may need to be adjusted if other building elements such as •
sarking are also installed. For example, sarking or sheet insulation under tiles may change a roof space from
“ventilated” to “unventilated”.
Thermal bridging: Irrespective of the framing material used, the minimum added R-Value  specified is deemed to •
include the effect of thermal bridging created by framing members in situations other than described in the following
point.
Thermal break: Because of the high thermal conductance of metal, a thermal break is to be provided where the•
ceiling lining of a house is fixed directly to the underside of the metal purlins or metal battens of a metal deck roof
or where there is no ceiling lining. 
The purpose of the thermal break is to ensure that the thermal performance of
this form of roof construction is comparable to that of a similar roof with timber purlins or timber battens. 
A thermal
break may be provided by materials such as timber
, expanded polystyrene strips, plywood or compressed bulk
insulation. 
The material used as a thermal break must separate the metal purlins or metal battens from the metal
deck roofing and achieve the specified R-Value . Reflective insulation  alone is not suitable for use as a thermal
break because it requires an adjoining airspace to achieve the specified R-Value  (see last point).
Location of insulation: 
The thermal performance of the roof may vary depending on the position of the insulation, •
the climatic conditions, the design of the house and the way in which it is operated. For example, insulation installed
under the roof, rather than on the ceiling, of a conditioned house with a large roof space is less ef
fective because
of the additional volume of roof air space that would need to be heated or cooled. Conversely
, for an unconditioned
house, the use of reflective insulation  is more effective when placed directly under the roof.
Choice of insulation: 
There are a number of different insulation products that may be used to achieve the minimum •
added R-Value . However, care should be taken to ensure that the choice made is appropriate for the construction
and climatic conditions as the location and relationship other building elements may not be suitable in all
circumstances for both practical and technical reasons. For instance, in some climate zones , insulation should be
installed with due consideration of condensation  and associated interaction with adjoining building materials.
Reflective insulation  and its adjoining airspace is considered to achieve the following R-Values  when used in
conjunction with the Total R-Value  of a pitched roof and flat ceiling construction. To achieve these values, the
reflective insulation must be laid directly under the roof cladding and have a minimum airspace of 15 mm between
a reflective side of the reflective insulation  and the adjoining lining or roof cladding. The actual R-Value  added by
reflective insulation and its adjoining airspace should be determined for each product which takes into consideration
factors such as the number of adjacent airspaces dimensions of the adjacent airspace, whether the space is
ventilated and the presence of an anti-glare coating. When reflective insulation has an anti-glare coating on one
side, the emittance value of that side will be greater than the value of the uncoated side. 
Also, where another
emittance value for reflective insulation is used (other than the value used in NT Table 13.2.3d ), care should be
taken to ensure that the number of airspaces allowed for is consistent with the form of construction and whether
the airspace is reflective, partially reflective or non-reflective. Where bulk insulation fills the airspace, the Total R-
Value  should be reduced to take account of the loss of airspace.
Explanatory Information : 13.2.3(5 ) and Table NT 13.2.3d  
When considering the reduction of insulation because of exhaust fans and recessed downlights, 1% of the ceiling area  
for a 200 m2 sized house would permit 2 bathroom heater-light assemblies, a laundry exhaust fan, a kitchen exhaust  
fan and either approximately 25 recessed downlights with 100 mm clearance to the insulation or approximately 10  
recessed downlights with 200 mm clearance to the insulation.

Explanatory Information  
Walls with a surface density of 220 kg/m2 or more are deemed to achieve acceptable levels of thermal performance  
due to their ability to store heat and therefore slow the heat transfer through the building fabric .  These walls are defined  
by surface density (kg/m2), which is the mass of one vertical square metre of wall, in order to reduce the complexity  
when measuring the mass of walls with voids.

Explanatory Information  
Shading devices can include fixed louvres, shading screens and other types of perforated or fixed angle slatted  •
shades. However, such devices need to be designed for the climate and latitude to ensure that summer sun  
penetration is restricted, while winter sun access is achieved.  
Gutters can only be considered as providing shading if attached to a shading projection such as a verandah, fixed  •
canopy, eaves, shading hood, balcony or the like.  
Shading devices can be either attached or located adjacent to the building. For example, a free-standing lattice  •
screen may be considered to provide shading to glazing  if it complies with NT 13.3.3(b)(ii).  
An adjustable shading device should be readily operated from a safe location or platform that does not require  •

Explanatory Information  
Complete discharge of the concrete from the truck should be made within one and a half hours of initial mixing with•
water unless a suitable retarder has been specified.
Compacting concrete by vibration removes air pockets and works the concrete thoroughly around reinforcement,•
service penetrations etc. and into corners of formwork to increase durability and resistance to termite infestation
and salt damp attack. Care should be taken not to over-vibrate.

Western Australia
ABCB Housing Provisions Standard 2022 Page 566Explanatory Information : Application of AS 1170.4  
There are certain limitations on the application to domestic structures such as Class 1a and Class 1b buildings in 
Appendix A of AS 1170.4. These limitations include building height, roof slope, etc. For additional information refer to  
Appendix A of AS 1170.4.  
 
Explanatory Information : Importance Levels (Table 2.2.3a)  
 
Table 2.2.3a  provides a generic description of building types to which Importance Levels have been assigned. The  
“Importance Level” concept is applicable to building structural safety only. More specific examples are provided in the  
following list. The examples are indicative and not exhaustive.  
Importance Level 1: Isolated minor Class 10a buildings and Class 10b structures.  •
Importance Level 2: Class 1 buildings; Class 10a buildings and Class 10b structures associated with Class 1  •
buildings.  
Importance Levels must be assigned on a case by case basis and relate to the hazards to human life and other property  
in the event of the structure’s failure. For example—  
Importance Level 1 is for minor isolated structures that rarely contain people, are not required as part of normal  (a)
infrastructure and present a low risk to life and other property . 
Importance Level includes domestic housing and structures intended to contain reasonable numbers of people  (b)
under normal operations.  
 
Explanatory Information : Construction in cyclonic areas  
 
The intent of building construction in cyclonic areas (see Figure 2.2.3 ) is to ensure the structure has sufficient strength  
to transfer wind forces to the ground with an adequate safety margin to prevent collapse of the building and the building  
being lifted, or slid off its foundations.  
To resist these forces it is necessary to have— 
an anchorage system, where the roof is connected by the walls to the footings by a chain of connections; and  •
a bracing system to prevent horizontal collapse due to wind forces; and  •
continuity of the system where each structural element is interlocked to its adjoining structural element throughout  •
the building.  
 
Explanatory Information : Anchorage 
Anchorage of the system is achieved by using a variety of connectors. Each connector must be capable of carrying the  
uplift force, because the ability of the building to resist the wind forces is directly related to its weakest link.  
 
Explanatory Information  
In Western Australia state variations apply to wind regions B and D, this includes wind region B2 as referenced in  
AS/NZS 1170.2.   
The state variation for wind region B or B2 will ensure that designers consider the combination of peak external  
pressures and increased internal pressures in design of buildings and use a cyclonic (C) classification instead of non-
cyclonic (N) classification. The definition of design wind speed  is varied in WA Schedule 1 to identify that wind Region  
B is a C classification in Western Australia. Other changes have also been made to reflect this.  
In addition to a variation to clause H1D7  of NCC Volume Two, and clauses 2.2.3  and 2.2.4  of the ABCB Housing  
Provisions Standard - a variation is made to the application of AS/NZS 1170.2 and AS 4055 (when used as a primary  
referenced document, secondary or subsequent referenced document). Refer to WA Schedule 2 and WA Part 2.3 .  
The state variation for wind region D applies only to those parts of region D located north of the Tropic of Capricorn.  
The 2021 edition of AS/NZS 1170.2 includes a reduction in design wind speeds for wind region D. The variation will  
retain similar design wind speeds for wind region D as the 2011 edition of AS/NZS 1170.2 previously referenced in the  
National Construction Code.

[New for 2022]  
Delete 5.3.1 of AS/NZS 1170.2:2021 and replace with the following:  
5.3.1 Internal pressure 
5.3.1.1 General Internal pressure is a function of the external pressures, and the leakage and openings in the external surfaces of  
the building or an isolated part of a larger building, and for some large buildings, the internal volume. The open area  
of a surface shall be calculated by adding areas of opening to areas of permeability or leakage on that surface of the  
building (e.g. vents and gaps in the building envelope).  
The height at which the design wind speed is determined for calculation of internal pressures shall be the average  
roof height (h), as defined in Figure 2.1. However, for the cases of windward wall leakage or openings on a building  
greater than 25 m in height, the design wind speed at the height of the opening shall be used.  
Pressure coefficients for internal pressure (Cp,i) shall be determined by either Clause 5.3.1.2 or 5.3.1.3.  
NOTE 1 Damage inspections after wind storms, in Regions B2, C and D, have shown that large openings are very  
likely to occur accidentally due to failure of elements under direct wind pressure, or in the lower levels of a building  
envelope, by debris impact. Large openings can also occur in Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4) under the same  
circumstances, although openings produced by debris impact are less likely.  
NOTE 2 The equivalent free area of a ventilator (e.g. ridge or under-eave ventilators) can be determined from the  
product of discharge coefficient and throat area.  
5.3.1.2 Internal pressure coefficients for all cases, except ultimate limit states for parts of buildings below 25  
m in Regions B2, C and D  
Clause 5.3.1.1 applies to buildings in all regions for serviceability limit states.  
For ultimate limit states, it applies to all buildings in Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4), and parts of buildings  
higher than 25 m above ground level in Regions B2, C and D.  
Pressure coefficients for internal pressure (Cp,i) shall be determined from Tables 5.1(A) or 5.1(B). Table 5.1(A) shall  
be used for the design case where there are no potential openings in any surface with a combined area greater than  
0.5 % of the total area of that surface, and the leakage in the walls lead to internal pressures. Table 5.1(B) shall be  
used for the design case where there are openings in any surface greater than 0.5 % of the total area of that surface,  
or they can be created accidentally.  
5.3.1.3 Internal pressure coefficients for ultimate limit states for parts of buildings below 25 m in Regions  
B2, C and D Pressure coefficients for internal pressure (Cp,i) for parts of a building in Regions B2, C and D below  25 m for ultimate  
limit states, shall be determined from Table 5.1(B) only.  
The ratio of the sum of opening areas on one surface to total open area of other walls and roof surfaces as defined  
in Table 5.1(B) shall not be taken to be less than two unless —  
(a)it can be demonstrated that an opening will not be created in the building envelope as a result of impact loading
from the windborne debris defined in Clause 2.5.8; or
(b)a permanently-open roof ventilator
, such as a ridge ventilator, has been installed with equivalent total area (see
Clause 5.3.1.1 Note 2) of at least that of the largest areas of any potential accidental openings in the walls, considering
the combined area of wall openings in each wall surface one at a time; or
(c)permanently-open, wall ventilators have been installed on at least two walls, with equivalent total area (see Clause
5.3.1.1 Note 2) of the ventilators on each wall at least that of the largest of any potential accidental openings in the
walls, considering the combined area of wall openings in each wall surface one at a time.
NOTE 1 Low-rise buildings in Regions B2, C and D should be designed for the high internal pressures resulting  
from large openings, for ultimate limit states. Even in cases where the opening is small or there is no opening, 
Table  
5.1(A) is not intended to be used for low-rise buildings in Regions B2, C and D for ultimate limit states.  
NOTE 2 To date, the majority of windborne debris in Regions B2, C and D in Australia has not often impacted at  
heights on buildings above 25 m. This is not the case in other parts of the world and could change in the future with  
increasing numbers of high-rise buildings.  WA 2.3.3

[New for 2022]  
Delete 5.3.2 of AS/NZS 1170.2:2021 and replace with the following:  
5.3.2 Openings  
5.3.2.1 General 
Openings shall be determined according to either Clause 5.3.2.2 (Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4), and Regions  
B2, C, D at heights of 25 m or above) or Clause 5.3.2.3 (Regions B2, C, D below 25 m).  
Subject to Clauses 5.3.2.2 and 5.3.2.3, combinations of openings and open area shall be assumed to give internal  
pressures, which, together with external pressures, give the most adverse wind actions.  
NOTE Potential openings include doors or windows that are left open or may fail, vents that are normally  
open and holes in cladding caused by impacts by windborne debris during a major wind event. Openings can be  
doors (including balcony doors) or windows that are left open, open under pressure, or open due to the failure of  
latches or hinges. When determining internal pressures, consideration should be given to scenarios in which large  
openings may develop. Openings may also be generated by debris impacts, particularly in Regions B2, C and D (see  
Clause 2.5.8).  
5.3.2.2 Openings in buildings in Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4), and parts of buildings at heights of 25  
m or above in Regions B2, C and D  
The full area of doors, including large access doors (e.g. roller doors), and windows that are normally closed, shall  
be regarded as openings, unless they are demonstrated to be capable of resisting the applied wind pressures.  
NOTE 1 When assessing internal pressures, designers should consider the principles of robustness, i.e. to avoid  
situations where the failure of a single component such as a door or window could lead to consequent and  
disproportionate failure of other elements, or even complete failure of the structure.  
NOTE 2 The structural assessment of doors that are assumed to remain closed and intact should include elements  
such as supports, frames, jambs, roller door guides, wind locks, latches and hinges, and fixings, where the resistance  
of doors relies on those. This assessment of roller doors and their supporting structural elements should also account  
for any structural resistance to any catenary actions developed by the door under wind load.  
5.3.2.3 Openings in buildings for ultimate limit states for parts of buildings below 25 m in Regions B2, C and  
D Doors (including large access doors) and windows that are normally closed, and cladding elements, shall be regarded  
as openings with an area equal to the greater of—  
(a)the full area of the element, where it has not been demonstrated that it can resist the applied wind pressures; or
(b)the area of opening that results from debris impact, where the debris impact loading criteria are defined in Clause
2.5.8.
